That second one means we have a way to retain structural data that can be leveraged for more structural queries!\n",

This includes component requirements from class maintenance plans.\\n\\nThe Ships\\' 3-M System consists of 1) the Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and 2) the Maintenance Data System (MDS). The Maintenance Data System provides information and reports for fleet maintenance and maintenance support. It produces and manages the Current Ship\\'s Maintenance Project (CSMP) Reports, manages the planning, scheduling, and reporting of maintenance, and gathers maintenance history, which is stored in the Ships\\' 3-M System database.\\n\\n Organization\\n\\nReference (b) Volume VI, Chapter 19 now delineates 3-M responsibilities for key organizational\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nmaintenance personnel in both the shipboard and shore-based environment.\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n 3-M Requirement Management Board (RMB) & Configuration Control Board (CCB)\\n\\na. The 3-M Requirements Management Board (RMB) was created in 2014 and establishes a repeatable process for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing stakeholder requirements in a forum that communicates, documents, and verifies these needs among all 3-M stakeholders. Comprised of representatives from USFF, CPF, CNAL, CNAP, CNSL, CNSP, CSL CSP, NECC, CNIF and CNIC as well as SEA 04, SEA 05, SEA 06, and NSLC, the 3-M RMB facilitates the identification and resolution of requirements and configuration issues that extend across functional and software application boundaries of the 3-M System. The specific purposes of the RMB are to provide OPNAV with a defendable list of prioritized 3-M requirements for FYDP planning; deliver a list of prioritized 3-M functional requirements to the 3-M CCB; and maintain all functional manager and fleet stakeholder 3-M requirements while ensuring they support the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM), reference (b) and NAVSEAINST 4790.8, the 3-M Manual. The 3-M RMB acts as the owner and user advocate of the functional-level requirements that have been identified as part of the NAVSEA 04 3-M Program, including applications, interfaces, products, and policies. The RMB is responsible for validating all 3-M requirements, including those initiated through Change Proposals (CPs).\\n\\nb. The 3-M Configuration Control Board (3-M CCB) was also created in 2014, and establishes and maintains technical and functional baselines for the 3-M System. The 3-M CCB provides integrated and disciplined oversight to produce a structured and streamlined control process for managing the 3-M System throughout its development and intended life cycle. Chaired by SEA 04RM, members include the NAVSEA 3-M Program Manager, Naval Sea Logistics Center Deputy Program Manager for 3-M, 3-M Functional Managers for U.S. Fleet Forces and Pacific Fleet, the NAVWAR Program Manager for maintenance systems, and the NAVSEA Program Manager for configuration. The 3-M CCB executes requirements approved by the 3-M RMB. It reviews change requests, analyzes the feasibility and impact of changes, proposes better or less expensive alternatives, tests and accepts software, updates policies, and communicates with stakeholders.\\nb.

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter provides Maintenance and Material Management (3-M) System policy and guidelines in support of the Planned Maintenance System (PMS.) PMS provides the command’s maintenance team with the tools to plan, schedule, and control planned maintenance effectively. The maintenance procedures developed under Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles are the minimum required to maintain equipment within specifications. Though standard in concept and procedure, PMS is flexible enough to be adjusted by the organization to be compatible with operational schedules and other demands.\\n\\n2. Scope\\n\\nPMS supersedes all previous planned or preventive maintenance systems or programs. Where a difference exists between the requirements and procedures of PMS and other technical publications or systems, PMS requirements will prevail. Differences should be reported using PMS feedback reporting procedures. Equipment not supported by PMS will continue to be maintained per existing manufacturer documentation, Systems Commands (SYSCOM) technical manuals or Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) technical manuals, until PMS is developed and installed. Naval Sea Logistic Center (NSLC) Detachments Norfolk and San Diego function as PMS Coordinating Activities (PMSCA) for the accountability and distribution of PMS documentation.\\n\\n3. Objective\\n\\nThe objective of PMS is to maintain equipment within design specifications through preventive maintenance and to identify and correct potential problems before the equipment or system becomes inoperable. PMS provides:\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\na. Comprehensive procedures developed under RCM principles for the planned maintenance of systems and equipment.\\n\\nb. Minimum requirements for planned maintenance.\\n\\nc. Scheduling and control of the performance of tasks.\\n\\nd.

Test procedures to determine material readiness.\\n\\ng. Assessment procedures to determine material condition of equipment.\\n\\n PMS Policy\\n\\nPMS policy dealing with RCM waivers; PMS responsibilities and procedures; PMS for new construction ships, ships in overhauled, in-service and new systems and equipment, alterations, and foreign navies; PMS Feedback Reports and their processing; and policy for PMS network software procedures are described in Appendix J of this instruction.\\n\\n PMS Functional Components\\n\\na. PMS Master File. The PMS Master File contains information relative to PMS requirements for specific equipment for which the command is responsible. The contents of the Master File are delineated in reference (a), the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM), Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\nb. PMS Work Center File. The PMS Work Center File reflects that portion of the PMS Master File applicable to a particular work center. The PMS Work Center File is designed to provide a ready reference of planned maintenance requirements and is retained in the work area for use by the Work Center Supervisor (WCS) and maintenance personnel. The contents of the PMS Work Center File are delineated in reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\nc. List of Effective Pages (LOEP). The LOEP, (Figure I-2-1) provides a listing of the Maintenance Index Pages (MIP) for systems and equipment assigned to each work center, those systems and equipment not requiring PMS, or those systems and equipment currently being evaluated for PMS. The LOEP is designated as the “PMS-5” report. The LOEP contains the data elements listed in subparagraphs 4.c.(1) through 4.c.(13):\\n\\n- (1) Report date, which is the date the LOEP is produced.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nThis table provides information related to Force Revision (FR) documentation for maintenance requirements in a naval setting.

Maintenance Index Page (MIP). MIPs (Figure I-2-2) are prepared and issued for each installed system or equipment for which PMS support has been established. MIPs are basic PMS reference documents. Each MIP is a complete index of Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC)s applicable to a ship system, subsystem, or equipment. MIPs contain the information and instructions listed in subparagraphs 5.d.(1) through 5.d.(16):\\n\\n(1) MIP SYSCOM Control Number. Three SYSCOM MIP control numbering systems have been developed based on changing PMS philosophy: Conventional, Surface Missile System (SMS), and RCM numbering systems. Preliminary MIPs are those documents not certified via the PMSCA, have yet to undergo a full RCM analysis, but are released in a preliminary format to support maintenance while the RCM analysis is being conducted. Since nearly all new maintenance requirements are established using RCM principles, preliminary control numbers are modified RCM MIP SYSCOM control numbers.\\n\\n(a) Conventional MIP SYSCOM Control Number. A four-segment code is used. The first segment identifies the equipment group and may contain from one to three characters\\n---\\nNAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nfollowed by a dash (-). The second segment identifies a specific subgroup or component number within an equipment group and may contain from one to four characters followed by a slash (/). The third segment identifies a distinct version within that equipment subgroup and may contain from one to three characters followed by a dash (-). The fourth segment contains two characters identifying the month and year the MIP was prepared or revised. The numbers 1 through 9 are used for the months January through September and the letters A through C are used for the months of October, November and December. The final character is a number indicating the last digit of the year the MIP was prepared or revised. For example, a conventional MIP SYSCOM control number may look like “A-061/701-A8” where the equipment group is A, the equipment subgroup or component number is 061, the version is 701, the month of issue is October and the year of issue is 1998, 2008, or 2018.\\n\\n(b) SMS MIP SYSCOM Control Number. A three-segment code is used. The first segment identifies the equipment group and contains seven alphanumeric characters followed by a slash (/). The second segment identifies the equipment configuration and contains three characters followed by a dash (-). If the first character in the second segment is “U”, this is Unscheduled Maintenance; otherwise, this is scheduled maintenance. The third segment contains two characters that identify the month and year the MIP was prepared or revised. For example, a SMS MIP SYSCOM control number may look like “5HEK000/003-78” where the equipment group is 5HEK000, the equipment configuration is 003, the month of issue is July, and the year of issue is 1998, 2008, or 2018.\\n\\n(c) RCM MIP SYSCOM Control Number. A three-segment code is used. The first segment contains four alphanumeric characters followed by a slash (/). The characters are based on the Expanded Ship Work Breakdown Structure (ESWBS) number. The second segment identifies the sequence of maintenance requirements development for this functional grouping or system, and contains three characters followed by a dash (-). The third segment contains two characters that identify the month and year the MIP was prepared or revised. For example, an RCM MIP SYSCOM control number may look like “4911/001-27” where the first segment an ESWBS-based number is 4911, the sequence of maintenance requirements is 001, the month of issue is February and the year of issue is 1997, 2007, or 2017.\\n\\n(d) Preliminary MIP SYSCOM Control Number. Identified by a “P” code and number in the second segment of the RCM MIP SYSCOM Control Number. For example, a preliminary MIP SYSCOM control number may look like “6628/P01-29” where the ESWBS-based number is 6628, the “P” before the second segment signifies “preliminary”, the sequence of maintenance requirements is 01, the month of issue is February and the year of issue is 1999, 2009, or 2019.\\n\\n(2) Date. Preparation date of the MIP by month and year. The date changes with each revision of the MIP or revision of an MRC on the MIP.\\n(d) Preliminary MIP SYSCOM Control Number. Identified by a “P” code and number in the second segment of the RCM MIP SYSCOM Control Number. For example, a preliminary MIP SYSCOM control number may look like “6628/P01-29” where the ESWBS-based number is 6628, the “P” before the second segment signifies “preliminary”, the sequence of maintenance requirements is 01, the month of issue is February and the year of issue is 1999, 2009, or 2019.\\n\\n(2) Date. Preparation date of the MIP by month and year. The date changes with each revision of the MIP or revision of an MRC on the MIP. 2-4\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(3) Ship System, System, Subsystem, or Equipment.

A seven-character alphanumeric code assigned to each MRC. It consists of three segments. The first segment contains two characters identifying the month and year the MRC was prepared and will only change when the MRC is revised. Numbers 1 through 9 are used for the months of January through September and letters A through C are used for the months of October, November and December. The final character is a number indicating the last digit of the year. The second segment is a four-character alphanumeric Library Control Number which uniquely identifies each MRC. The last character may be a “Y” (indicating repair parts are required for this MRC), an “N” (indicating repair parts are not required for this MRC), or a “U” (indicating this is an unscheduled maintenance MRC and may require parts).\\n\\n(9) Maintenance Requirement Description. Brief description of each maintenance requirement.\\n\\n(10) Periodicity Code. Delineates how frequently the maintenance requirement must be performed. The periodicity code may be followed by either an asterisk (*) or a plus sign (+). An asterisk indicates a Safety of Ship item and requires the ship or user to comply with reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19. A plus sign indicates this procedure is primarily intended to be scheduled for accomplishment by off-ship maintenance personnel for those classes of ships (e.g. LCS, DDG 1000) that utilize off-ship personnel for PMS. If the periodicity is followed by a symbol, a note will be placed on the document explaining the symbol to ensure clarity. Some MIPs that have the off-ship maintenance indicators are applicable to multiple classes of ships.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nFor those ships that do not use off-ship maintenance personnel to accomplish O-level maintenance, those indicators are to be ignored.\\n\\n(11) Rates. Identifies the recommended skill level of the person(s) considered capable of performing the maintenance requirement(s). Qualified personnel other than the rate or rank specified may be assigned. Substitution of other personnel is not allowed when a Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) code, Damage Control Petty Officer (DCPO), or Safety Petty Officer (SPO) is assigned with the exception of civilian personnel whose Position Description (PD) requires the performance of preventive maintenance. Civilian personnel, including contractors, must be qualified through 3-M Personnel Qualification Standard (PQS) or a Job Qualification Requirement (JQR) and are authorized to perform maintenance actions associated with their PD.\\n\\n(12) Man-Hours (M/H). The average time, per equipment, per person, needed to perform the maintenance requirement(s), not including time for tool preparation and return, tag out, or removal and replacement of interference. When performing maintenance on systems that must meet certification requirements, including but not limited to SUBSAFE, REC, Level 1 controls, Fly-by-Wire (FBW), and SOC systems, the M/H determination for maintenance should include the time required for completion of those in-process certification requirements. M/H is listed in hours and tenths of an hour.\\n\\n(13) Related Maintenance. There are three types of related maintenance, listed in subparagraphs 5.d.(13)(a) through 5.d.(13)(c). If no related maintenance exists, the MIP reflects “None” in the related maintenance column.\\n\\n- (a) Mandatory.

There may be more than one MIP series listed when an MRC applies to more than one group.\\n- MRC SYSCOM Control Number. A seven-character alphanumeric code assigned to each MRC. It consists of three segments. The first segment contains two characters identifying the month and year the MRC was prepared and will only change when the MRC is revised. Numbers 1 through 9 are used for the months of January through September and letters A through C are used for the months of October, November and December. The final character is a number indicating the last digit of the year. The second segment is a four-character alphanumeric Library Control Number which uniquely identifies each MRC. The last character may be a “Y” (indicating repair parts are required for this MRC), an “N” (indicating repair parts are not required for this MRC), or a “U” (indicating this is an unscheduled maintenance MRC and may require parts).\\n- Periodicity. Identifies the interval in which a maintenance task must be performed. There are three categories of periodicities: calendar, non-calendar, and IEM. The authorized periodicities are listed in subparagraphs 5.e.(5)(a) through 5.e.(5)(d):\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\neight months. An asterisk (*) following the periodicity code indicates a Safety of Ship item and requires the ship or user to comply with reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\n Periodicity Codes:\\nThis table provides a list of frequency options represented by abbreviations such as D for Daily, W for Weekly, M for Monthly, Q for Quarterly, S for Semi-annually, and A for Annually.,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Frequency Abbreviation: None\\n\\nThis table provides a list of frequency options represented by abbreviations such as D for Daily, W for Weekly, M for Monthly, Q for Quarterly, S for Semi-annually, and A for Annually.,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Frequency Abbreviation: None\\n\\n|1.|D – Daily|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.0|W – Weekly|\\n|3.0|M – Monthly|\\n|4.0|Q – Quarterly|\\n|5.0|S – Semi-annually|\\n|6.0|A – Annually|\\n\\n(b) Calendar Periodicity Date Ranges. The SKED program tracks all calendar periodicities using the unit of days. MRCs are displayed as out of periodicity when they fall outside the established date range in the SKED program.

OT – Operational Test\\n\\n(e) Periodicity Code Numbering. The periodicity code also includes a number for specific identification. When more than one MRC of the same periodicity exists in the same MIP, the MRCs should be numbered consecutively, e.g., “D-1”, “D-2”, “D-3”, or “M-1”, M-2”, etc. An existing MRC may be reapplied to a revised MIP even though the periodicity code of the reapplied MRC may not fall within the numeric sequence assigned to the revised MIP’s MRCs. For example, W-1, W-2, W-3, W-6 may appear on a MIP, where W-6 was an existing MRC that was reapplied to this equipment. Technically valid MRCs will not be reprinted merely to change the periodicity code number. Non-sequential numbers will not affect scheduling or management control.\\n\\n(6) Location. This block contains the specific location of the equipment, sourced from a SKED 3.2 maintenance group, or a TYCOM-authorized check-off list detailing equipment location.\\n\\n(7) Ship System, System, Subsystem, and Equipment.

Qualified personnel other than the rate or rank specified may be assigned. Substitution of other personnel is not allowed when an NEC code, DCPO, or SPO is assigned with the exception of civilian personnel whose PD requires the performance of preventive maintenance. Civilian personnel, including contractors, must be qualified through 3-M PQS or a JQR and are authorized to perform maintenance actions associated with their PD.\\n\\n(9) Man-Hours. The average time, per equipment, per person, needed to perform the maintenance requirement(s), not including time for tool preparation and return, tag out, or removal and replacement of interference. When performing maintenance on systems that must meet certification requirements, including but not limited to SUBSAFE, REC, Level 1 controls, Fly-by-Wire (FBW), and SOC systems, the Man-hour determination for maintenance should include the time required for completion of those in-process certification requirements. Man-Hours are listed in hours and tenths of an hour. Total Man-hours is the sum of all entries in the Man-hour blocks, not including time for tool preparation and return, tag out, or time needed for removal or replacement of interference.\\n\\n(10) Maintenance Requirement Description. A brief description of the maintenance action to be done, presented as an imperative sentence (e.g., \"Change Fuel Oil Filter.\" or \"Measure System Tangential Sensitivity\").\\n\\n(11) Safety Precautions. A listing of those warnings and references which direct attention to possible hazards to personnel which could result in death or injury while doing maintenance.

This block contains the required tool(s), part(s), material, test equipment, and miscellaneous item(s) necessary to perform the maintenance action. Items are identified by the applicable Standard PMS Item Name (SPIN) number in brackets. The SPIN is a number assigned to TPMTE that can be referenced to the Standard PMS Materials Identification Guide (SPMIG) for stock number identification. The stock numbers for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are also listed in the Hazardous Materials User’s Guide (HMUG). The five basic TPMTE categories are listed in subparagraphs 4.e.(12)(a) through 4.e.(12)(e):\\n\\n- (a) Category I - Test Equipment. Category I is used only for General Purpose Portable Electrical and Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) listed in the Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment Index (TMDE-I). Test equipment required to support a maintenance action should be listed by Sub-Category (SCAT) code which identifies the general group under which test equipment models have been approved to support specific measurement requirements. Those approved models can be found within the SCAT search on the TMDE-I. The Ship/Shore Portable Electrical/Electronic Test Equipment Requirements List (SPETERL) establishes allowances for GPETE for ships and shore activities under NAVSEA cognizance. Those allowances are identified by SCAT code. MRC test equipment requirements are synchronized with the SPETERL. For any test equipment item required and not identified by SCAT, contact navsea_gpete_help@navy.mil.\\n- (b) Category II - Materials. Materials include a wide range of administrative supplies and housekeeping items which may not be consumed entirely. Some consumable items such as grease, oils, or solvents are consumed each time the maintenance action is performed whereas others such as buckets, funnels, or ladders are not.\\n- (c) Category III - Parts. Parts are defined as any items, which are an integral part of the equipment. For example: gaskets, mechanical seals, packing material, O-rings, filters, etc. The medium for identification of PMS part requirements is the Allowance Equipage List/Allowance Parts List (AEL/APL). Ship unique repair parts are not listed in the SPMIG.\\n- (d) Category IV - Tools. Category IV covers common hand tools of all types except “special tools”.\\n- (e) Category V - Miscellaneous. Category V covers all equipage items as well as any other special tools or materials not otherwise covered under categories I through IV. As a general rule, all items, which are identified and supported through AELs, will be considered Category V. Special tools are equipment-unique tools that are designed for a particular piece of equipment by the manufacturer. Such tools always have a manufacturer’s part number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. Per NAVSEA and Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) policies, special tools will be listed on the APL and are, therefore,\\n\\n2-12\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nClassified as repair parts. Equipage items are Category V even though some may be used as a tool; for example, jacking gear.\\nCategory IV covers common hand tools of all types except “special tools”.\\n- (e) Category V - Miscellaneous.

Identifies additional control measures, precautions, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and spill controls for the hazardous material identified in the TPMTE block. Examples of statements currently in use:\\n\\n- (a) For Forces Afloat, the Hazardous Material Users Guide (HMUG), S9086-WK-STM-020, NSTM Chapter 670 Volume II provides additional control measures, precautions, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and spill controls for the hazardous material(s) identified in the Tools, Parts, Materials, Test, Equipment block.\\n- (b) For other forces (expeditionary, shore based units, units based at a host nation facility), OPNAVINST 5100.23 (series) provides guidance for Hazardous Material Control and Management (HMC&M) and directs the use of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) to determine additional control measures, precautions, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and spill controls for the hazardous material(s) identified in the Tools, Parts, Materials, Test Equipment block.\\n- Maintenance personnel must determine if additional PPE is necessary to accomplish the MRC and take appropriate action to obtain and wear such PPE to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Final disposition of all HAZMAT, both shipboard and ashore, must use local Hazardous Material Minimization Center (HAZMINCEN)/ Consolidated Hazardous Material Reutilization and Inventory Management Program (CHRIMP) guidance as required by OPNAVINST 5090.1 series Table 35-4. Report any deficiencies via PMS feedback report.\\n- (c) Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU), Charleston (CHASN) Instruction (INST), Occupational Safety and Health Manual (OSHMAN), and the applicable Safety Data Sheets (SDS) provide additional control measures, precautions, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and spill controls for the hazardous materials.\\n\\n(14) Procedure. This block details the sequence of steps to be followed in performing the maintenance action. An MRC must be a complete maintenance document containing all the information required to perform the task. Reference to other approved procedures must be restricted to an extreme minimum and must be approved by the PMSCA before inclusion on the MRC. Supporting documentation references are incorporated into the MRC and unless directed by a procedural step, are not required to be utilized in conjunction with performing an MRC. They may be referenced to gain a better understanding of the procedural steps, general safety precautions, or higher-level requirements if confusion exists regarding the direction provided. As data may vary between ships, the MRC may contain blanks in which the ship’s company must supply the data necessary to properly do the work, e.g., pressure settings, temperature settings, brush tension, limiting speed, tolerances, and levels. The necessary data can generally be found in the equipment or system technical manual, ship’s information book, ship’s and equipment drawings, Naval Ships’ Technical Manual (NSTM), or Operational Sequencing\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nSystem (OSS). If the data necessary to fill in the blanks is not available, the Ship’s Force should submit a PMS Feedback Report (FBR) requesting the required data.\\n\\n(15) Warnings/Safety Precautions/Notes. These items appear throughout the Procedure block and will be listed prior to applicable steps or procedural actions.\\n\\n- Warning. Warnings are associated with personal safety. Failure to adhere to the warning could result in injury to personnel. Warnings are listed in the Safety Precautions block in the same order as they appear in the procedure. They are repeated immediately preceding the procedural step involved. For example, a Warning may read, “WARNING: Asphyxiation Hazard!\\nIf the data necessary to fill in the blanks is not available, the Ship’s Force should submit a PMS Feedback Report (FBR) requesting the required data.\\n\\n(15) Warnings/Safety Precautions/Notes. These items appear throughout the Procedure block and will be listed prior to applicable steps or procedural actions.\\n\\n- Warning. Warnings are associated with personal safety. Failure to adhere to the warning could result in injury to personnel. Warnings are listed in the Safety Precautions block in the same order as they appear in the procedure. They are repeated immediately preceding the procedural step involved. For example, a Warning may read, “WARNING: Asphyxiation Hazard! No tank, void, or confined space will be entered until it has been ventilated, inspected and certified by a Gas Free Engineer (GFE), or National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) marine chemist. Toxic gases may exist.”\\n- Caution. Cautions are associated with equipment safety. Failure to adhere to the Caution could result in damage to equipment. Cautions are not listed in the Safety Precautions block but must precede the procedural step involved. For example, a Caution may read, “CAUTION: Use silicone based lubricant only to lubricate O-ring. Petroleum based lubricant will damage O-ring resulting in leaks.”\\n- Note. Notes are procedural advisories. Notes must not direct any action except to identify alternative procedural steps to which the technician is to proceed, or identify those steps which should be omitted for a specific situation or configuration. All notes are sequentially numbered and must precede the procedural step involved. For example, a Note may read, “NOTE 2: Venting of hydraulic control valve may require dumping of External Hydraulic Accumulator by momentarily opening HE-1911. Hydraulic accumulator should not read FULL prior to cycling control valve.”\\n\\n(16) Footers. Information provided at the bottom of the MRC.\\n\\n- OPNAV Form Serial Number. For example, “OPNAV 4790/85 (REV. 9-97).”\\n- Page Information. For example, “Page 1 of 10.”\\n- SYSCOM MRC Control Number. The three segment code used in cataloging MRCs is located as a footer on the right side of each page of each MRC. For example, “SYSCOM: 85 6HJB Y”.\\n\\nf. Classified MRCs. Classified MRCs are printed on pink stock with the classification indicated at the top and bottom of each page. Classified MRCs and handling procedures for classified information on Digital Video Disks (DVD) will be handled per reference (c). When MRCs are classified, an unclassified locator card is provided. The locator card duplicates the\\n\\n2-14\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nInformation in all of the MRC blocks except the procedures block and includes one of the 17 Jun 2021 following statements:\\n\\n- (1) “Maintenance procedure with the requirement is CONFIDENTIAL. Maintenance Requirement Card is stowed in __________.”\\n- (2) “Maintenance procedure with the requirement is SECRET. Maintenance Requirement Card is stowed in __________.”\\n\\ng. Pointer MRCs\\n\\n1. Pointer MRCs are similar to Locator cards in that they direct the maintainer to a complete document for accomplishing a particular maintenance task. For example, an MRC on a system MIP calls out a calibration maintenance requirement at a set periodicity. The calibration task is an Annual periodicity and the procedure itself is applicable to many components on the unit. The system MIP reflects an Annual requirement to accomplish the calibration but the pointer MRC directs the maintainer to another MIP that actually contains an unscheduled (“U”) MRC reflecting the procedure. That same type of component in another system may require less frequent calibration and the pointer MRC on that system MIP will direct the maintainer to the same unscheduled procedure.\\n2. Pointer MRCs will reference only one other complete MRC when used in the Scheduled Maintenance area of the MIP but can reference one or more MRCs when used in the IEM section of the MIP. For example, a Start-Up MRC may point to numerous MRCs to bring a system or equipment back in service after a lay-up period. The pointer MRC would direct accomplishment of a number of scheduled maintenance actions (Accomplish MRCs M-1, M-4, Q-8, S-7, A-1 etc.). A pointer MRC will only be utilized when the entire procedure (including the maintenance requirement) of the MRC, to which it points, is exactly the procedure required for performance of the specified task.\\nThat same type of component in another system may require less frequent calibration and the pointer MRC on that system MIP will direct the maintainer to the same unscheduled procedure.\\n2. Pointer MRCs will reference only one other complete MRC when used in the Scheduled Maintenance area of the MIP but can reference one or more MRCs when used in the IEM section of the MIP. For example, a Start-Up MRC may point to numerous MRCs to bring a system or equipment back in service after a lay-up period. The pointer MRC would direct accomplishment of a number of scheduled maintenance actions (Accomplish MRCs M-1, M-4, Q-8, S-7, A-1 etc.). A pointer MRC will only be utilized when the entire procedure (including the maintenance requirement) of the MRC, to which it points, is exactly the procedure required for performance of the specified task. The only portion of the “pointed to” MRC that can change is the “Ship System,” “System,” “Sub-System,” and “Equipment” designations in the heading block. If any other information (primarily procedural) is different between the pointer MRC task and the MRC to which it points, the relationship is broken and a new complete MRC will be generated.\\n\\nh. Situational Requirement. A PMS situational requirement is a preventive maintenance task that is to be accomplished only when a specified situation, known event, or set of circumstances occur. A situational requirement defines an event that must occur for an MRC to be scheduled. MRC periodicities of these tasks are identified with an “R.” Situational requirements must have a note describing the situation that invokes the maintenance requirement. This note must be the first entry in the Procedure block. Situational requirements are made of the events and elements listed in subparagraphs 5.h.(1) and 5.h.(2).\\n\\n1. Events.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(a) State. A state event is a persistent event that can be tracked over a duration of time (in days). It is a toggle that is either “on” or “off” and corresponds to the current state of the ship, equipment, or status. The use of a state indicates a change in maintenance requirements due to the persistent event. Obvious state event examples are “at sea” and “in port.” You are either “at sea” or “in port,” you cannot be in both at the same time. State should not be confused with a prerequisite (see subsequent paragraph 5.h.(2)(d) below) which indicates the conditions which must exist for the maintenance to be performed. In some situations, there will be a periodic maintenance requirement that is scheduled while in a state. An example would be R-1W, where the state may be “while at sea” and the maintenance requirement is then “weekly” while in that state.\\n\\n(b) Trigger. A trigger event is a single occurrence or action that may have a maintenance action tied to it. A trigger could happen more than one time in a single day, or may go weeks or months without ever happening. Trigger event examples are “getting underway” and “entering port” which would bookend the “at sea” state event.\\n\\n(c) Metered. A metered event is an event that is based on the current value of a measurement in relation to that value at the time of last accomplishment. The measurement parameters are defined at the MRC level. An example of a metered event would be “every 600 hours of engine run time.” Another example of a metered event would be one that occurs when metered data reaches a specific numeric trigger which then schedules the MRC. A plus or minus value may be provided to specify an acceptable range for accomplishing the maintenance (example: Accomplish after 250 +/- 25 arrestments).\\n\\n(2) Elements.\\n\\n(a) Situational Parameter. A situational parameter is used to further define the specifics of how a generic situational requirement is applied to the specific MRC. This is similar to “filling in the blanks” of the situational requirement.\\n\\n(b) Offset Information. Offset information is an aid that is used to determine when the MRC is scheduled based on the occurrence of the event (example: Prior to or after getting underway). The offset will generally have a timeframe associated with it such as 96 hours, 48 hours, etc., and would be written as “96 hours prior to getting underway.” In this example, it should be noted that the 96 hour offset is provided to give the maintainer sufficient time to accomplish the task prior to the event happening.\\nA plus or minus value may be provided to specify an acceptable range for accomplishing the maintenance (example: Accomplish after 250 +/- 25 arrestments).\\n\\n(2) Elements.\\n\\n(a) Situational Parameter.

Generally, it is not imperative that the task be accomplished exactly 96 hours prior to getting underway, just that the task be accomplished prior to the event. If a task must be accomplished in an exact offset timeframe, the task should be explicit in stating so. If an offset parameter is not specified, the MRC is scheduled the day the event occurs. The WCS must have the flexibility to schedule maintenance requirements around his or her timeframes and workload. Thus, in the example cited above, such a requirement may be accomplished within that 96-hour period prior to getting underway.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(c) Periodicity. A periodicity parameter specifies how often to schedule the MRC while in the situational requirement state. For example, “While at sea (state), perform quarterly (periodicity).”\\n\\n(d) Prerequisites. A prerequisite specifies the situation that must exist in order for the maintenance to be accomplished, and has no effect on scheduling. Examples would be “Dry Deck”, “360-degree visibility”, or “a sea state of 4 or less.” A prerequisite of “At Sea” or “In Port” should not be confused with the state which creates the condition in which the maintenance requirement becomes schedulable. A prerequisite is normally utilized as a Scheduling Aid on the MIP and a Note on the MRC.\\n\\n- Situational Requirements with Calendar Periodicities. Situational requirement codes may be used with a calendar periodicity code in circumstances when both the situation and the calendar periodicity govern the scheduling of the requirement. Examples include:\\n- M-1R - Monthly or every 600 operating hours, whichever occurs first.\\n- W-3R - Weekly or after each use, whichever occurs first.\\n- S-1R - Semiannually or during each upkeep period, whichever occurs first.\\n- Q-1R - Quarterly or prior to getting underway, whichever occurs first.\\n- R-1W - When a “specified situation occurs,” accomplish weekly. (i.e. Lube Oil Cooler is in Freshwater Lay-up, check level weekly)\\n\\nUnscheduled Maintenance Requirements. Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those actions required to restore a system or equipment to an operational condition within predetermined tolerances or limitations. Unscheduled maintenance requirements evolve from system or equipment failures or other indications of system or equipment degradation and include alignment, adjustment, and repair. Unscheduled maintenance procedures are depicted on unscheduled MRCs (See Figure I-2-4), and may be listed on system or equipment level MIPs or MIPs developed specifically for unscheduled MRCs. Their use may be directed by a scheduled MRC, scheduling aid, or system/equipment failures. Unscheduled checks that do not apply to ships configuration and are not called out by other PMS that resides on the ships schedule will be lined out.\\n\\nAssessment Procedures. Assessment Procedures (AP) are developed following the procedures in Section II, Chapter 4 of this manual. They are provided to assist maintenance managers with the identification of deficiencies for the planning and accomplishment of requirements during future availabilities and executed by outside activities with Ship’s Force participation. These MRCs will not be placed on the work center schedule unless accomplished by Ship’s Force as the nature of these checks are for Maintenance Planning Managers/Port\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nEngineers to use for detection of required repairs by outside activities and are provided to Ship’s Force for informational purposes only. MRCs listed in this section need not be placed on the ships schedule nor printed. Ships must maintain AP card MIPs on their List of Effective Pages (LOEP) as long as the applicable equipment is held by that work center.\\nAssessment Procedures.

Ships must maintain AP card MIPs on their List of Effective Pages (LOEP) as long as the applicable equipment is held by that work center. The recording of completed APs by off-ship personnel is recorded on the Work Candidate, and Ship’s Force participation is recorded in their completion remarks on that Work Candidate. There is no need for recording Ship’s Force participation in an assessment event on the PMS schedule.\\n\\nLocation and Use of MRCs. Each Work Center must maintain applicable MRCs. Maintenance personnel will use these to perform assigned planned maintenance per the requirements of reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI Chapter 19.\\n\\nPolicy for MRC Accomplishment. MRCs are prepared as instructions to complete a maintenance task based upon the premise that the personnel assigned to perform the task have sufficient knowledge of the rate listed on the card, and are qualified to perform maintenance as directed by the MRC.\\n\\n- The MRC must be accomplished in sequential order, adhering to all Warnings, Cautions and Notes. Routine sub-steps (e.g., fastener removal, steps to don and remove PPE, turning on a vacuum) may or may not be included in the MRC and their absence should not prevent the maintainer from completing the maintenance task.\\n- Procedures are written at a level of detail based on the assumption maintenance personnel are trained, qualified and supervised by experienced leadership to consistently and expertly execute the maintenance. They exist to provide a common standard, specify acceptance criteria, communicate warnings and cautions specific to the maintenance and provide proven maintenance practices. They are not intended to:\\n- Supplement or duplicate rules and procedures that must be followed for hazards generally associated with the equipment (Hazardous Material Handling, Electrical Shock Risk Management, etc.) but not specifically associated with a step of the procedure.\\n- Identify every process and every warning associated with the maintenance environment of the component being maintained (Aloft, In Tanks, Near an Active Flight Deck, In a Heat Stress area, etc.)\\n- Specify every possible action of the maintainer.\\n- Leadership must uphold standards for complying with maintenance procedures. This standard does not mean the maintainer is expected to robotically follow the MRC word-by-word. Leadership, trainers, monitors, auditors and inspectors should not expect it. The key word here is intent. The objective is to perform the intent of each step (step-by-step) performance.\\n\\n2-18\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(4) If a step is missing that is necessary to complete the task, and that step is not obvious to the maintenance person, an FBR should be submitted.\\n\\n(5) MRC completion status is dependent on the accomplishment of all procedural steps on all of the equipment listed on the MRC, its accompanying Equipment Guide List (EGL) or Location Guide List (LGL) to include inspections where material deficiencies were noted during accomplishment.\\n\\n(6) The performance of additional rational actions during the accomplishment of an MRC is authorized. Examples of such actions include turning on and off items utilized during the performance of the MRC (vacuum cleaners, test equipment, etc.) and general housekeeping (cleaning up or containing spilled fluids or dirt). Performing these actions in no way detracts from the accomplishment status.\\n\\n(7) The substitution of any tools, materials or test equipment not held by the activity should be considered prior to deciding to defer the maintenance until the exact tools, materials or test equipment listed on the MRC are procured. This is especially critical for frequently required maintenance where several performance cycles can be missed while waiting for supply to provide the correct items.\\n\\nn. Shipboard Authorized Changes to MRCs. See reference (a), JFMM, Vol. VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\no. PMS Trend Data. If directed by the Fleet Commander or subordinate commanders, trend data records (e.g., bearing clearances, resistance test readings, etc.) will be established and maintained for designated equipment.\\nand general housekeeping (cleaning up or containing spilled fluids or dirt).

Shipboard Authorized Changes to MRCs. See reference (a), JFMM, Vol. VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\no. PMS Trend Data. If directed by the Fleet Commander or subordinate commanders, trend data records (e.g., bearing clearances, resistance test readings, etc.) will be established and maintained for designated equipment. The purpose of this data is to identify equipment or component trends by recording readings or other historical data over continuous periods of time.\\n\\np. Preliminary PMS Documentation. Preliminary documents provide new or changed procedures that have not been given a final engineering validation. This documentation falls into two categories:\\n\\n- (1) Preliminary MIPs without MRCs. Preliminary MIPs without MRCs are forwarded by the SYSCOMs via the NSLC and provide guidance in maintaining equipment not covered by PMS. Their purpose is to aid the activity in identifying and scheduling maintenance. The activity may develop interim MRC procedures based on experience and applicable technical manuals in support of these MIPs until formal documentation is received. Before scheduling preliminary MIP requirements, the WCS and the Department Head must verify their applicability to installed equipment. Preliminary MIPs are identified by a “P” code and number (P01) following the slash of the SYSCOM MIP control number.\\n- (2) Preliminary MIPs with MRCs. Preliminary MIP(s) with MRC(s) are provided by the SYSCOMs via the NSLC for use while the MIP(s) and MRC(s) are undergoing final technical review. Preliminary MIP(s) are identified by a “P” code and number (P01) following the slash\\n\\n2-19\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nof the SYSCOM MIP control number. Preliminary MIP(s) are reviewed and approved by the 17 Jun 2021 designated technical review activity. The approved MRC(s) will be provided in a subsequent FR following approval.\\n\\nq. Advance Change Notices (ACN). PMS ACNs are authorizations for, and a record of, changes to an existing MIP or MRC, or the addition of a new MRC. ACNs are issued in advance of the release of the next FR and are incorporated in either that FR or a subsequent FR. ACNs are normally issued as a result of safety-related revisions but can also reflect updates to maintenance or equipment requirements. All ACNs are sent via encrypted e-mail.\\n\\n- Types of ACN Changes. Types of changes indicated on PMS ACNs are listed in subparagraphs 5.q.(1)(a) through 5.q.(1)(e):\\n1. Periodicity of accomplishment.\\n2. Deletion or modification of an existing MR.\\n3. Addition or modification of an MRC procedural note or figure to clarify the content or description of a procedural step.\\n4. Procedural step modification to correct technical data, e.g., frequency, pressures, voltages, current, decibels, resistance values, clearance, test data, etc.\\n5. Addition or modification to the list of tools, parts, materials, and test equipment.\\n- Control and Tracking of ACNs. Control and tracking of each ACN will be accomplished in the manner listed in subparagraphs 5.q.(2)(a) through 5.q.(2)(d):\\n1. A PMS ACN will refer to a specific MIP and MRC that is being altered and the locations of the revisions will be indicated visually by a vertical change bar on the left side of each MIP and MRC page. A revised MIP and MRC, in PDF format, will be sent by physical or electronic means as necessary to all holders.\\n2. Each PMS ACN is serialized. The serial number consists of the “ACN” indicator, originating activity code, MIP number, serial number, log number and date.\\n3. NSLC will maintain accountability of all outstanding ACNs by MIP and MRC. The revised MIP will incorporate superseded ACNs.\\n4.\\n- Control and Tracking of ACNs. Control and tracking of each ACN will be accomplished in the manner listed in subparagraphs 5.q.(2)(a) through 5.q.(2)(d):\\n1. A PMS ACN will refer to a specific MIP and MRC that is being altered and the locations of the revisions will be indicated visually by a vertical change bar on the left side of each MIP and MRC page. A revised MIP and MRC, in PDF format, will be sent by physical or electronic means as necessary to all holders.\\n2. Each PMS ACN is serialized. The serial number consists of the “ACN” indicator, originating activity code, MIP number, serial number, log number and date.\\n3. NSLC will maintain accountability of all outstanding ACNs by MIP and MRC. The revised MIP will incorporate superseded ACNs.\\n4. The activity 3-M Coordinator (3MC) must record the receipt of each ACN, maintain a copy in the PMS Master File, and distribute a copy to the appropriate Work Center(s).\\n\\n2-20\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(3) Special Issues. Special Issues are a category of ACNs and are issues, as in 17 Jun 2021 distribution, of new documentation between FRs. A Special Issue represents a new MIP and at least one new MRC. A Special Issue may reflect newly developed documentation or may reflect a change in the documentation a Command receives, such as the addition of a MIP or MRCs to the Work Center LOEP due to the addition of new equipment. Each Special Issue is serialized on every page. The serial number consists of the Special Issue indicator “SI”, originating activity code, serial number, MIP number, MRC number (if applicable), and revision date. Special Issues will be forwarded as a response to a locally-generated FBR to the applicable hulls and activities. Special Issues will be sent by encrypted e-mail. A record of Special Issues must be maintained in the Work Center and PMS Master File.\\n\\nr. Pen and Ink Changes. Pen and Ink changes are revisions to any aspect of existing PMS documentation and are authorized in FBR responses. In contrast to ACNs, Pen and Ink changes provide interim measures as a result of minor changes due to updated maintenance or equipment requirements. Pen and Ink changes provide detailed instructions for specific MIPs, MRCs, or both. All Pen and Ink changes are sent electronically via encrypted e-mail as FBR responses. Subsequently NSLC will distribute revised MIPs and MRCs reflecting Pen and Ink changes to all affected MIP holders via FR. A record of Pen and Ink changes must be maintained in the Work Center and PMS Master File.\\n\\ns. 13-Week Accountability Log. The WCS must maintain a 13-Week Accountability Log. Requirements and maintenance of the 13-Week Accountability Log are detailed in reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19. Units employing SKED 3.2 must use the Personal Identification Number (PIN) functionality to record disposition of an MRC. Using PIN functionality eliminates the requirement to sign and date an MRC completion on a 13-week accountability sheet. The assigned crewmember will be recorded along with the disposition (complete, not applicable, etc.). This will become a permanent record once the week has been closed out. All PMS maintenance assigned to a maintenance person is presented to them immediately upon SKED 3.2 log-on, and chain of command review can be tracked on the weekly closeout signature sheet. Therefore, when a ship/unit is utilizing SKED 3.2 PIN functionality, there is no need to retain the 13-week accountability log.\\n\\n6. PMS Feedback Report. The PMS FBR is used to notify NSLC of matters related to PMS. Feedbacks are used to report problems and also to request PMS coverage for newly installed systems or equipment. While a request for PMS coverage will provide initial PMS coverage and changes, submission of an OPNAV 4790/CK form is required to initiate the rest of the logistic support process. SKED users must submit FBRs via SKED where they are assigned a serial number for tracking purposes. Non-SKED users submit FBRs via the PMS Management Information System (PMSMIS) website at https://algol.pmsmis.navy.mil/PMSMIS/default.aspx by selecting the Feedback tab and Feedback Wizard. Non-SKED users accessing this website for the first time will need to request an account.

An e-mail will be sent to the requester confirming the new account and providing access to the main screen.\\n\\n Types of PMS Feedback Reports\\n\\n(1) CAT A (Non-Technical). This type of FBR is non-technical in nature and is intended to meet PMS needs which do not require technical review, including changes in Work Center LOEPs. These FBRs are submitted to request classified or other PMS documentation, which cannot be obtained locally. See an example of a CAT A (Non-Technical) FBR in Figure I-2-5.\\n\\n(2) CAT B (Technical). This type of FBR is technical in nature and is used to report technical discrepancies inhibiting PMS performance. Category B FBRs are either Routine or Urgent. See an example of a CAT B (Technical) FBR in Figure I-2-6.\\n\\n- (a) Routine. An FBR is Routine when the reason for submission relates to the technical requirements of the documentation and it does not deal with safety of ship or personnel. It is used to report technical discrepancies or request clarification of MRC procedures.\\n- (b) Urgent. An FBR is Urgent when the reason for submission involves safety of personnel, safety of ship, or the potential for equipment damage if the MRC procedure is followed as written. Urgent FBRs will be forwarded to both NSLCs, the cognizant SYSCOM, BUMED, NAVSAFECEN and TYCOM by naval message containing a PMS FBR Serial Number. An Urgent FBR should be drafted in SKED to obtain an FBR serial number that can be included in the naval message Figure I-2-7. Once the message has been sent, the date time group of the message can be included in the FBR and the FBR submitted. The message must describe the unsafe procedures or conditions, and must identify the MIP / MRC involved.\\n\\n NSLC FBR Processing\\n\\nPMSCAs NSLC Norfolk and San Diego process CAT A FBRs expeditiously and answer CAT B FBRs by electronic means when possible. When NSLC cannot resolve a CAT B FBR, their actions are listed in subparagraphs 6.b.(1) through 6.b.(4). (See Appendix J for additional information on FBR processing).\\n\\n- NSLC will electronically forward the FBR to the designated technical review activity for resolution.\\n- NSLC will maintain the PMSMIS copy of the FBR.\\n- NSLC will provide the ship an electronic notice identifying what action is pending and by whom.\\n- All related changes in documentation must be reflected in a subsequent revision.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nc. Technical Review Activities Processing. A technical review activity is an organization assigned system responsibility by the Technical Warrant Holder that reviews and maintains maintenance requirement documentation. The cognizant technical review activity receiving FBRs for resolution must analyze, categorize, and process these FBRs as described in subparagraphs 6.c.(1) and 6.c.(2). (See Appendix J for additional information dealing with NAVSEA and other system command actions related to the processing of feedback reports).\\n\\n(1) Urgent FBRs. SYSCOM or BUMED technical review activities must provide a preliminary response to the originator by message, info NAVSAFECEN Norfolk, and NSLC within 1 working day of receipt. This message response must be distributed to all TYCOMs of units holding the affected documentation. TYCOMs will forward this message to all commands that could be affected by the PMS change.\\nA technical review activity is an organization assigned system responsibility by the Technical Warrant Holder that reviews and maintains maintenance requirement documentation.

SYSCOM or BUMED technical review activities must provide a preliminary response to the originator by message, info NAVSAFECEN Norfolk, and NSLC within 1 working day of receipt. This message response must be distributed to all TYCOMs of units holding the affected documentation. TYCOMs will forward this message to all commands that could be affected by the PMS change. Responses to Urgent FBRs must not be delayed because a naval message is not received in a timely manner.\\n\\n(2) Routine FBRs. The technical review activity must provide the resolution to the question asked in the FBR to NSLC by direct entry into the PMSMIS or other electronic means. The response may contain corrections to PMS documentation, superseded documentation, or an explanation of the reasons for non-concurrence. The response may also defer concurrence with the ship’s recommendation or request further investigation. Electronic responses are preferred over paper. NSLC will provide an electronic response to the originator.\\n\\nd. Processing Goal. NAVSEA has established a goal of providing an FBR response in 1 day. NAVSEA realizes that there are certain FBRs that will require more extensive research to answer and these FBRs will not be answered in 1 day. However, the vast majority can and should be answered much sooner. Technical review activities are required to answer all FBRs submitted to them within 21 working days.\\n\\ne. Updated Documents. NSLC will provide all holders of the affected MIP(s) and MRC(s) with updated documents in the next FR when the technical review activity concurs with an FBR or initiates documentation revisions in support of an FBR resolution.\\n\\n 7. PMS Force Revision\\n\\nInstalled PMS packages are periodically updated to reflect changes in systems, equipment, and package configuration and to provide new or revised PMS documentation. FRs are normally effective on the first Monday of the quarter and are mailed prior to the beginning of a quarter to allow adequate preparation prior to the scheduled implementation date. When an FR is not received in time to permit implementation on the first Monday of the quarter, the actual date of implementation will be designated by the Executive Officer. Safety-related PMS updates are required to be implemented within 2 to 5 working days of receipt.\\n\\na. FR Package Contents. All PMS FR information and reports are contained on the PMS DVDs and listed in subparagraphs 7.a.(1) through 7.a.(8): 2-23\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nTable listing various documents and reports related to the PMS program, including ALID, LOEP Report, PMS Activity to MIP to Work Center File, and others.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nAutomated Library Issue Document (ALID) and Related Reports,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Document/Report: None\\n\\nTable listing various documents and reports related to the PMS program, including ALID, LOEP Report, PMS Activity to MIP to Work Center File, and others.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nAutomated Library Issue Document (ALID) and Related Reports,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Document/Report: None\\n\\n|(1) Automated Library Issue Document (ALID).

FR Procedures. Use SKED Revision Editor to apply the FR procedures. These procedures apply to all PMS revision types used in SKED.\\n\\n- (1) PMS revision package will be addressed, “Attention: 3-M System Coordinator.”\\n- (2) The FR number is listed in the upper right-hand corner of the ALID. This number will be the same for all ships and commands and will identify each FR in the calendar year. For example, the first package issued in calendar year 2017 was assigned the number 1-17.\\n- (3) Commands having no additions or changes will receive a copy of the ALID with a statement, “No Master File changes reflected by this FR.”\\n- (4) Ships in overhaul will receive FR packages. Updating procedures for PMS packages during overhaul are contained in Section I, Chapter 3.\\n- (5) Procedures for implementation of FRs are outlined in reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n- (6) NSLC provides PMS DVDs to the TYCOMs with each FR along with various PMS reports as requested. An example is the MIP to Hull File, Report PMS 2A, which identifies each hull to which a given MIP is applicable within that TYCOM. The reports are available on the DVDs. Contact NSLC for additional information on available reports.\\n\\n PMS Self-Assessment\\n\\nThe ability of the activity to perform critical self-assessment is instrumental to the success of all command programs, including PMS. An integral part of a self-assessment program is the assessment of the material condition of systems and equipment. Reference (d), the Standard Organization Regulations of the U.S. Navy (SORM), requires every command conduct periodic inspections, “Zone Inspections,” to ensure proper measures are taken to keep machinery, spaces and equipment clean, operational and in a satisfactory state of preservation. As a minimum, each space will be formally inspected at least once per calendar quarter. Reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19 deals with command inspections and self-assessments.\\n\\na.  The Commanding Officer is responsible for the effective assessment of the material condition of the activity. The Commanding Officer must assign duties and responsibilities in support of Zone Inspections per TYCOM instructions.\\n\\nb.  Zone inspections will emphasize safety, preservation, damage control readiness, material condition and cleanliness, as well as specific items of interest, and will be structured to ensure\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nrapid correction of major discrepancies that could cause injury to personnel, damage to 17 Jun 2021 equipment or constitute a fire hazard. Special emphasis must be placed on the elimination of fire hazards, safety hazards and the proper stowage of hazardous materials. Refer to TYCOM instructions for the documentation and abatement requirements for Zone Inspection deficiencies.\\n\\nc. The designated Zone Inspection program manager should ensure all personnel who are assigned as Zone Inspectors are qualified to conduct inspections and that the Commanding Officer is provided routine reports regarding the \"as found\" material condition of the command.\\n\\nd. All material condition deficiencies that require corrective maintenance, regardless of significance, must be entered into the MDS. The utilization of specific Zone Inspection management tools does not satisfy this requirement.\\n\\n Equipment Not Covered by PMS\\n\\na. Reasons for Non-Coverage. There are various items of equipment in the fleet which do not have PMS coverage. Reasons for this are numerous and include:\\n\\n- (1) Insufficient funds for development of PMS.\\n- (2) Non-delivery of technical documentation for equipment previously delivered and installed.\\n- (3) Determination that planned maintenance is not required, due to either item cost (typically less than $5,000 for replacement), or the item has no unique impact on mission, safety, or regulatory requirements.\\n- (4) Equipment or systems that are planned for disposal, and as such, not economical for PMS development.\\n\\nb. Classification of Equipment Not Covered by PMS. The terms listed in subparagraphs 9.b.(1) and 9.b.(2) have been established for use in PMS to aid in the classification of equipment or system status. SYSCOMs, BUMED, INSURV, and fleet units will be provided a status report of such equipment for use as a reference in determining the scope of PMS coverage and deficiencies in coverage.\\n\\n- (1) Maintenance Requirement Substantiated (MRS).\\n- (2) Non-delivery of technical documentation for equipment previously delivered and installed.\\n- (3) Determination that planned maintenance is not required, due to either item cost (typically less than $5,000 for replacement), or the item has no unique impact on mission, safety, or regulatory requirements.\\n- (4) Equipment or systems that are planned for disposal, and as such, not economical for PMS development.\\n\\nb.

The classification MRS is given to equipment which has been analyzed by the designated technical review activity and the need for PMS requirements established. A requirement then exists for final development and the equipment is so identified for technical review activity action. The MRS Code is also listed in the PMS automated LOEP for each ship and command in which the equipment is installed.\\n- (2) No Maintenance Required (NMR). The term NMR can be assigned to equipment only if no maintenance other than normal housekeeping actions is required to keep the equipment in good operating condition or if it is determined that the development of PMS is not required. Designated technical review activities must provide either an RCM or cost analysis to justify an\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nNMR determination. Once an NMR determination is made, the item will be listed on the LOEP for the ship on which the equipment is installed.\\n\\nResponsibilities for Providing Coverage:\\n\\nWhen a ship, activity or TYCOM considers there is a need for equipment PMS coverage, the steps in subparagraphs 9.c.(1) and 9.c.(3) will be taken.\\n\\n1. The ship or activity will notify NSLC by PMS FBR of the need for PMS coverage.\\n2. If, through the development process, planned maintenance tasks are identified, NSLC may forward preliminary MIPs and MRCs to the applicable ships and activities for those items coded “MRS” and send a copy to the TYCOM.\\n3. If preliminary MIPs and MRCs are not provided by NSLC, the command may develop and schedule interim procedures based on applicable technical manuals, documentation, and quality maintenance processes. These locally developed procedures must be submitted through the PMSCA as recommendations for the development of formal PMS.\\n\\n Inactive Equipment Maintenance\\n\\nA piece of equipment or system intentionally placed in a hibernated state for a specific period of time with the intention of reactivating that equipment or system at the end of that period.\\n\\nStatus I. Equipment that will:\\n\\n1. Remain onboard.\\n2. Is not scheduled for corrective maintenance or overhaul.\\n3. Will be inactive during extended shutdown periods and maintenance availabilities as determined by the Department Head.\\n\\nExample: Submarine CO2 Removal Plant in wet or dry Lay-up.\\n\\nNOTE: Perform a \"wet lay-up\" (CO2 Removal Plant filled with distilled/demineralized water) prior to entering port when the ship is expected to be in port for 7 to 45 days or a \"dry lay-up\" (CO2 Removal Plant left empty after flushing and draining), prior to entering port when the ship is expected to be in port for greater than 45 days, or prior to entering port when maintenance requiring the removal of all CO2 Removal Plant fluid is expected.\\n\\nStatus II. Equipment that is inactive and:\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(1) Subject to corrective maintenance, overhaul, or removal for safe storage 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(2) Temporarily transferred to another activity for maintenance responsibility for extended shutdown periods as determined by the Department Head. Example: Submarine Refrigeration Compressor removed for Depot level overhaul.\\n\\n c. Implementation and Responsibility\\n\\nWhile inactive, minimum maintenance is performed in order to ensure the success of the reactivation. The IEM section of the MIP will cover this maintenance.\\n\\n(1) To implement procedures for the accomplishment of PMS for equipment declared in an inactive status, current PMS schedules are modified to annotate the requirements listed in the IEM section of the MIP. For advance planning and scheduling of maintenance to take place, it is necessary to determine and identify the extent to which unit/ship force personnel will conduct PMS during an inactive period. MIPs in each Work Center will be reviewed to determine if equipment has IEM coverage (e.g.\\nExample: Submarine Refrigeration Compressor removed for Depot level overhaul.\\n\\n c. Implementation and Responsibility\\n\\nWhile inactive, minimum maintenance is performed in order to ensure the success of the reactivation. The IEM section of the MIP will cover this maintenance.\\n\\n(1) To implement procedures for the accomplishment of PMS for equipment declared in an inactive status, current PMS schedules are modified to annotate the requirements listed in the IEM section of the MIP. For advance planning and scheduling of maintenance to take place, it is necessary to determine and identify the extent to which unit/ship force personnel will conduct PMS during an inactive period. MIPs in each Work Center will be reviewed to determine if equipment has IEM coverage (e.g. LU, PM, SU, and OT), if the coverage is adequate, and what procedures are to be follow if there is no IEM coverage on the MIP or provided coverage appears inadequate. The Department Head is responsible for determining equipment IEM status. When placing a system or equipment in IEM status, the Department Head will also determine the IEM start date to be reflected in SKED. The IEM end date will not be applied in SKED until the system or equipment is ready to be brought out of IEM status. All periodic PMS scheduled at the end of IEM should be reviewed for applicability, with applicable maintenance accomplished prior to operating equipment.\\n\\n(2) IEM procedures are listed on MIPs and separated from operational PMS by a horizontal line. The IEM section is titled \"Inactive Equipment Maintenance\" and is prefaced by the following statement: \"The following requirements will be scheduled when equipment is inactivated for periods of prolonged idleness.\" When there are no IEM requirements the words \"None required\" will appear under the Inactive Equipment Maintenance Section of the MIP. When IEM procedures are inadequate, submit an FBR. The unit/ship should consider all factors that affect equipment deterioration and take necessary precautionary measures. These factors include environmental conditions, equipment location, susceptibility to damage, or other factors that cannot be anticipated when IEM procedures were originally developed by the cognizant ISEA or design activity.\\n\\n(3) The lack of IEM requirements on a MIP does not prohibit placing that system/equipment into an inactive state. Additionally, certain locations require precautions and maintenance not required force-wide. The unit/ship should consider all factors that affect equipment deterioration and take necessary precautionary measures. The WCS or Leading Chief Petty Officer (LCPO) for SURFOR units, is responsible for identifying factors that are inadequate and may require additional preparation and maintenance of the inactive equipment while reporting the same to the Department Head for approval. Factors may include\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nenvironmental conditions, equipment location or susceptibility to damage. For those actions that are recurring in nature, the WCS must submit an FBR for possible MRC development.\\n\\nd. IEM Periodicity Codes. Periodicity codes (LU, PM, SU, OT) are assigned to all IEM actions available on the MIP.\\n\\n(1) Lay-Up Maintenance (LU). Lay-Up maintenance actions prepare pe equipment for periods of prolonged idleness, and are usually performed only once at pe beginning of pe inactive period.\\n(2) Periodic Maintenance (PM). Periodic maintenance actions are accomplished on a recurring basis during pe inactive period to prevent equipment deterioration. These maintenance actions are usually operational PMS requirements specified via a note on pe MIP. They are performed eiper at pe same periodicity or at a different periodicity wip a note specifying pe frequency of accomplishment.\\n(3) Start-Up Maintenance (SU). Start-Up maintenance actions ensure pat equipment is in a condition suitable for operation and are used to reactivate an equipment or system pat has been inactivated for a prolonged period. Start-up maintenance consists of performing turn-on procedures and restoring pe equipment to its ready-for-service condition.\\n(4) Operational Test (OT). Operational test actions are pose conducted to determine pe operational condition of pe equipment, its ability to function as designed, and be integrated wip oper equipment to form a system.\\n\\ne. IEM MRCs. IEM MRCs are assigned SYSCOM MRC control numbers in the same manner as operational MRCs. When an IEM MRC is utilized to refer to an operational MRC, the periodicity indicator will be its IEM requirement. The skill level will reflect the most senior person required on the operational MRC(s), and man-hours block will reflect an appropriate amount of time for that person to review the requirements for the task(s) identified (normally 0.1 or 0.2 M/H).\\n\\nf. IEM Scheduling. SKED provides the capability to perform IEM scheduling.\\nStart-up maintenance consists of performing turn-on procedures and restoring pe equipment to its ready-for-service condition.\\n(4) Operational Test (OT).

IEM Scheduling. SKED provides the capability to perform IEM scheduling.\\n\\n(1) Status I. The scheduling of maintenance for Status I inactive equipment utilizes conventional PMS scheduling techniques. LU checks will automatically be added to pe schedule at pe beginning of IEM by SKED. PM checks will be manually added to pe schedule by pe WCS for pe period of IEM according to pe guidelines of pe MIP. At pe conclusion of IEM, SU checks and routine PMS will automatically be added to pe schedule by SKED. SU checks must be accomplished pe week IEM ends. All periodic checks added at pe end of IEM, can be moved to pe right, not to exceed pe allowable date range. Since pe MRC date range cannot be applied to pe left (into pe IEM period), pe MRC date range can only be moved to pe right, and perefore only pe plus value of pe specific range, i.e., pe date range for a monply is 2-29\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n21 – 41 days. The requirement can only be moved (scheduled) 10 days to the right and will not 17 Jun 2021 go into \"alert\" until after the 10 th day. This allows the Maintenance Person/WCS scheduling flexibility within the plus side of the date range of the MRC.\\n\\n(2) Status II. The scheduling of maintenance for Status II inactive equipment utilizes conventional PMS scheduling techniques, however, not all scheduled IEM PMS may need to be accomplished by the unit/Ship’s Force. LU checks will automatically be added to the schedule at the beginning of IEM by SKED, and may be marked N/A if the LU check did not support the equipment being removed from the ship/unit, or \"Accomplished by Higher Authority\" symbol if completed by the Intermediate or Depot level maintenance activity. PM checks may be required to be schedule during the IEM period. At the conclusion of IEM, SU checks and routine PMS will automatically be added to the schedule by SKED. SU checks must be accomplished the week IEM ends, and may be marked with the \"Accomplished by Higher Authority\" symbol if they were completed by the Intermediate or Depot level maintenance activity. Routine PMS added at the end of IEM may also be marked with the \"Accomplished by Higher Authority\" symbol if they were completed by the Intermediate or Depot level maintenance activity. All periodic checks added at the end of IEM, can be moved to the right, not to exceed the allowable date range. Since the MRC date range cannot be applied to the left (into the IEM period), the MRC date range can only be moved to the right, and therefore only the plus value of the specific range, i.e., the date range for a monthly is 21 – 41 days. The requirement can only be moved (scheduled) 10 days to the right and will not go into \"alert\" until after the 10 th day. This allows the Maintenance Person/WCS scheduling flexibility within the plus side of the date range of the MRC.\\n\\nSupply Materials Required Prior to Inactivation. Certain advance preparations are necessary to properly prepare for IEM. Reference documents such as CSMPs, Ship Alteration and Repair Package (SARP), LOEPs, MIPs, and MRCs should be reviewed by the shipboard maintenance manager well in advance of a planned idle period. A comprehensive list of the needed equipment and materials required may be prepared by reviewing the IEM MRCs for the items called out under “Tools, Parts, Materials, Test Equipment.” Care must be exercised in the selection of cleaning agents, detergents, solvents, adhesives, cements, and similar materials to avoid the use of materials, which are not authorized. On submarines, refer to the effective edition of the Submarine Material Control List and to references (e) and (f).\\nThis allows the Maintenance Person/WCS scheduling flexibility within the plus side of the date range of the MRC.\\n\\nSupply Materials Required Prior to Inactivation.

On submarines, refer to the effective edition of the Submarine Material Control List and to references (e) and (f).\\n\\nMeeting IEM Requirements. In some cases, accomplishing IEM requirements will require that portable equipment such as exhaust blowers, heaters, and dehumidifiers are available. In other situations, special materials for protecting idle ship equipment must be used. Many items required in implementing IEM are normally used or stocked on the ship and are, therefore, readily available. Lubricants, cleaning agents, rags, hand tools, and test equipment are typical among these items. Arrangements for loan and extended use of portable equipment during an overhaul period should be made with a tender or other repair or overhauling activity. In assessing equipment requirements, duplication of effort and equipment redundancy should be avoided. For instance, a particular overhaul action under shipyard responsibility may include\\n\\n2-30\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nprovisioning of equipment, material, or services otherwise assumed to be part of IEM 17 Jun 2021 requirements. In such cases, yard versus ship responsibility for supplying materials will be determined.\\n\\n 11. Deactivated Equipment\\n\\nDeactivated Equipment.

The Program Office/Ship Platform Manager, will provide direction to deactivate a piece of equipment or system to the TYCOM. The Program Office/Ship Platform Manager will provide specific direction concerning placement of the equipment in a deactivated state. This guidance could be as simple as direction to tag out physical and electrical isolations or as complex as a formal configuration changes for the physical divorcing of the equipment or system from other equipment/systems on the ship/unit. No maintenance will be performed after it has been deactivated.|\\n|---|---|\\n|b.|Should the ship/unit seek to deactivate a system/equipment, the Commanding Officer/Officer In Charge provides the request to the TYCOM via Naval Message.

Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Installation (Shipboard)\\n\\nType Commanders (TYCOMs) are responsible for ensuring the proper installation and operation of PMS within the ships and activities under their command.\\n\\n a. Preparation of Materials\\n\\nPrior to the PMS installation, equipment configuration information will be verified by the Configuration Data Manager (CDM). The PMS Maintenance Index Page (MIP) and Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) documentation will be certified by the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) sites Norfolk and San Diego. Following the validation, NSLC will assemble the PMS documentation, equipment listings, schedules, and forms required for the installation package. Each PMS installation package is tailored to the ship. Installation packages consist of:\\n\\n- (1) A transmittal letter with an inventory of installation materials.\\n- (2) List of Effective Pages (LOEP).\\n- (3) PMS Master File.\\n- (4) One Work Center PMS Manual for each Work Center. The Work Center PMS Manual reflects that portion of the PMS Master File that contains the planned maintenance requirements applicable to a particular Work Center and includes a deck of associated MRCs and PMS Feedback Report (FBR) forms.\\n- (5) A PMS delivery and installation reporting card.\\n\\n b. PMS Load-Out\\n\\nNSLC is responsible for installing PMS aboard ship. PMS is installed in two phases: preliminary and final.\\n\\n- (1) Preliminary PMS Installation. A preliminary, time-phased PMS package that is tailored to the ship’s manning and compartment acceptance plan will be built and installed as ship construction continues. Close coordination between the Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP), NSLC, and the ship, monitored by the TYCOM, will continue through final PMS installation. PMS installation phases may be altered to accommodate manning phases. The goal is to bridge the gap between acceptance of a space and PMS installation, minimizing damage to equipment and systems during this transition period.\\n- (2) Final PMS Installation. A final, formal, ship-wide PMS installation, which represents the full PMS package installation, will correspond with the ship’s commissioning plan. NSLC\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nwill notify the ship of a proposed final PMS installation date, the names and security clearances of team members, and a brief overview of the procedures. Subparagraphs 1.b.(2)(a) through 1.b.(2)(c) provide a general time frame for installations:\\n\\n- (a) Submarines. Approximately 3 months prior to shipbuilder’s Event 25 (Initial Fill). The sequence of events is as follows:\\nThis table outlines the steps involved in preparing a ship\\'s systems and databases prior to Event 25, including placing the ship in the FR database, building user accounts, conducting approvals, and going live with PMS.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nSteps for Ship Preparation Prior to Event 25,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Step: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\nThis table outlines the steps involved in preparing a ship\\'s systems and databases prior to Event 25, including placing the ship in the FR database, building user accounts, conducting approvals, and going live with PMS.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nSteps for Ship Preparation Prior to Event 25,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Step: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\n|1.|Place ship in FR database (PMSMIS) and therefore on the FR disk one quarter prior to Event 25.|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.0|TYCOM request UIC database build from NSLC.|\\n|3.0|TYCOM load UIC database onto ships NIAPS LAN.|\\n|4.0|TYCOM load FR in SKED.|\\n|5.0|Ship\\'s 3MC build user accounts in SKED and Chain-Of-Command.|\\n|6.0|Ship conducts FR approvals and go live with PMS, placing systems that have yet to be turned over in IEM.|\\n\\n“In Service”.\\n\\n- (b) Nuclear Powered Surface Ships.

NSLC will conduct briefings during the preliminary PMS installation phase and final installation process. A TYCOM representative should be present at these briefings.\\n\\n1. The installation team leader will conduct a top-management level briefing for the benefit of the Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, 3-M Coordinator, and Department Heads. The purpose of the briefing will be to provide refresher training in the concept and management aspects of PMS. The briefing will be scheduled once the majority of Department Heads are aboard the pre-commissioning unit based on the ship\\'s commissioning plan.\\n2. The installation team will conduct a briefing at the Division Officer and Work Center level. This briefing will consist of PMS concepts and detailed procedures directed to the maintenance personnel. It will be held once the majority of Division Officers and Work Center Supervisors have reported aboard. Additional briefings will be conducted by the TYCOM as required during preliminary periods.\\n3. NSLC will brief the 3-M Coordinator during the formal, full PMS package installation.\\n\\n3-2\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nd. Inventory of Installation Package 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(1) Inventory of Preliminary PMS Package. NSLC will provide a copy of the latest PMS package applicable for the ship class with the ship’s known PMS assigned and available for scheduling. The ship will monitor the pre-commissioning space acceptance progress and inventory equipment associated with spaces to be accepted. The ship will use the PMS package to identify applicable PMS and will coordinate with NSLC to acquire PMS documentation for those equipment and systems under Ship\\'s Force control. NSLC will assist the ship if PMS cannot be identified for a system to be accepted. It is the ship\\'s responsibility to validate the PMS for their hull.\\n\\n(2) Inventory of Final PMS Package. The PMS installation team, in conjunction with ship personnel, must conduct an inventory of the installation package received from NSLC. This will be done to ensure the package contains all materials necessary for the PMS installation. The installation team will compile a list of all deficiencies and discrepancies. The installation team will forward this list directly to NSLC for immediate corrective action.\\n\\ne. Installation Completion Check List. During the preliminary PMS package build, the installing activity will develop a check list to use during the PMS installation. This checklist will be used to ensure that:\\n\\n(1) All PMS Work Center Supervisors are instructed in using the Automated Scheduling Program to do their PMS schedules and instructed in the preparation of Equipment Guide Lists (EGL) and Location Guide Lists (LGL).\\n\\n(2) Supply personnel are familiar with the Standard PMS Item Name (SPIN), Standard PMS Material Identification Guide (SPMIG), and other responsibilities in support of Ships’ 3-M Systems.\\n\\n(3) The 3-M Coordinator, Division Officers, Chief Petty Officers (CPO), and Leading Petty Officers (LPO) can access the Local Area Network (LAN) and the Internet from their work stations. Demonstrate the ability to connect to the Revised Alternative Dataflow Web (RADWEB), Configuration Data Manager’s Database – Open Architecture (CDMD-OA), and on-line 3-M Manual as required.\\n\\n(4) An adequate number of the Ships\\' 3-M Manuals, OPNAV 4790 forms, and TYCOM 3-M Systems instructions are available onboard.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n2. Update of Shipboard PMS Package during Overhaul Period 17 Jun 2021\\n\\nThe procedures listed in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.e establish the general guidelines within which NSLC, overhaul activities, TYCOMs, and ships will function to ensure that an adequate and accurate PMS update is accomplished prior to completion of a regular overhaul or any lengthy availability.\\nTable ID: id_564  \\nTable Title: PMS Update Package Request Timeline  \\nSummary: This table outlines the timeline for requesting a PMS update package from NSLC prior to the start of an overhaul.  \\nKeep Table: Yes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n\\nTable ID: id_564  \\nTable Title: PMS Update Package Request Timeline  \\nSummary: This table outlines the timeline for requesting a PMS update package from NSLC prior to the start of an overhaul.  \\nKeep Table: Yes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n\\n|a. Prior to Overhaul.|Three months prior to the start of overhaul, the responsible Regional Maintenance Center (RMC) will initiate a letter of request to NSLC for a PMS update package. When the availability or overhaul date is not known 90 days prior to the start of overhaul, the request will be made as soon as it becomes known. Thirty days prior to the start of overhaul and after receipt of the RMC request, NSLC will provide the documents named in subparagraphs 2.a.(1) through 2.a.(3):|\\n|---|---|\\n| |(1) PMS 4 (MIP to Work Center Listing)|\\n| |(2) PMS 5 (List of Effective Pages Listing)|\\n| |(3) One set of all updated MIPs and unclassified MRCs.|\\n\\nb. List of Effective Pages (LOEP) Validation. In conjunction with Ship’s Force, the RMC must verify the PMS 4 and 5 listings with onboard equipment configuration and identify adds, changes, and deletes per RMC procedures. The total update package consisting of an Annotated PMS 5 (LOEP) and LOEP update list should be sent by the NSLC to the RMC and the ship periodically during overhaul, but definitely by the end of the overhaul. This will allow the ship to begin PMS coverage prior to receipt of the Force Revision (FR). Data submitted will be incorporated into the next FR. Items lacking PMS coverage but needing planned maintenance must be added to the Maintenance Requirements Substantiated (MRS) listing.\\n\\nc. Procedure Development. When tasked and funded, NSLC must coordinate the development of PMS requirements for MRS items.\\n\\nd. Distribution of Documentation. The responsible NSLC Det. will provide the updated PMS documentation directly to the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) activity and the ship via the normal FR cycle until the end of overhaul, at which time only the ship will continue to receive PMS documentation via FR updates.\\n\\ne. PMS Update Process. The PMS update process for overhaul periods is shown in Figure I-3-1.\\n\\n3. Shore Units, Schools and Training Commands\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\na. Installation Teams. Installation teams are not provided to shore units, schools and 17 Jun 2021 training commands for installing or updating PMS. However, sufficient training is available on both the east and west coasts to assist these activities in readying staff and instructor personnel for the receipt, distribution of materials, and execution of the PMS program. These training courses are delineated in Section IV, Chapter 1.\\n\\nb. Shore Units, Schools and Training Commands. Shore Units, schools and training commands are responsible for the same functions as specified for shipboard PMS installation and updates. Following receipt of a PMS package or FR update from NSLC, implementation of new and updated PMS documentation must be accomplished using existing procedures as described in Chapter 2 of this section.\\n\\nPage Number\\n3-5\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D PMS Update Process 17 Jun 2021 NSLCS\\nThe table is about providing RMC sites with PMS-9, PMS-10, Certification Files & Semiannual Updates.

Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide the 3-M Program’s Maintenance Data System (MDS) policy and guidelines in support of Organizational (O) level maintenance and material reporting.\\n\\n 2. Scope\\n\\nThis chapter specifies the requirements for O-level MDS reporting. It requires the reporting of maintenance actions and configuration changes on all categories of equipment. Maintenance data collection or reporting requirements, not specified in this manual, will not be levied on fleet units by the shore establishment without prior approval of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV N43).\\n\\n 3. Objective\\n\\nThe 3-M program provides a means to effectively manage and control organizational-level maintenance. It is primarily managed via the Current Ship\\'s Maintenance Project (CSMP). A thorough and accurate CSMP reflects the material condition of the ship or activity. This objective is achieved by:\\n\\n- a. Reporting maintenance actions.\\n- b. Reporting configuration changes.\\n- c. Producing CSMP reports.\\n- d. Producing work requests and work candidates.\\n- e. Producing deficiency documents for use by the Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV).\\n- f. Providing information necessary to evaluate and improve readiness, reliability, maintainability, and availability of installed systems and equipment.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\ng. Providing maintenance history information to the 3-M System Central Database.\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n 3-M O-Level MDS\\n\\na. MDS. Provides the maintenance and material managers throughout the Navy with the means to plan, acquire, organize, direct, control, and evaluate manpower and material resources expended or planned for expenditure in support of maintenance. It allows for information collected by maintenance personnel to be recorded only once and the maintenance database thereafter will provide information to all who have a need for it. It is the responsibility of each Work Center Supervisor (WCS) to ensure that the CSMP accurately describes the material condition of the Work Center. It is imperative that for each maintenance action:\\n\\n- (1) Proper equipment is identified.\\n- (2) Correct codes are used.\\n- (3) The Chain of Command reviews each transaction.\\n- (4) Proper supply documents are generated to ensure that the correct parts are ordered.\\n\\nb. Classification. The CSMP must contain UNCLASSIFIED data only but that data is business sensitive and must not be made available for public release.\\n\\nc. Databases. Various automated systems have been developed to reduce the administrative workload associated with maintenance, provide users with a responsive and flexible facility for on-line management of maintenance, and improve the accuracy and timeliness of existing up-line reporting. The ability to accurately document, track, and maintain configuration and maintenance history is critical for maintaining proper logistics support.\\n\\n- (1) The NSLC 3-M Systems Central Database is the focal point for receipt and distribution of UNCLASSIFIED maintenance and material data. Each reporting activity must ensure that narrative data sent up-line to this database does not contain any classified or Navy Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI). Ships equipped with the Propulsion-Organizational Maintenance Management System (P-OMMS) should refer to the reference (a), the Naval Nuclear Material Management manual, for P-OMMS operating requirements. The Naval Nuclear Material Management manual will provide additional information to resolve differences between the requirements in this manual and NAVSEA 08 guidance documents.\\n- (2) The Configuration Data Managers Database–Open Architecture (CDMD-OA) serves as the Navy\\'s central repository for Ship Configuration and Logistic Support Information (SCLSI). This information also assists in Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and repair. CDMD-OA provides information used by Naval Supply Systems Command-Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP-WSS), Mechanicsburg, for the calculation of allowances of repair parts\\n---\\nNAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nCarried onboard. Updates via the Automated Shore Interface (ASI) are made available to the 17 Jun 2021 activity on a continuous basis. This enables the supply department to easily maintain its Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) and order repair parts as an automated process.\\nThe Naval Nuclear Material Management manual will provide additional information to resolve differences between the requirements in this manual and NAVSEA 08 guidance documents.\\n- (2) The Configuration Data Managers Database–Open Architecture (CDMD-OA) serves as the Navy\\'s central repository for Ship Configuration and Logistic Support Information (SCLSI).

This enables the supply department to easily maintain its Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) and order repair parts as an automated process. See reference (b), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19 for TYCOM-specific ASI requirements.\\n\\nCDMD-OA is also used to identify the technical manuals, PMS documents, and test equipment necessary to support unit or activity equipment and systems. Accurate reporting of configuration data is critical to ensure logistics documentation and parts support is available.\\n\\nNAVSEA SEA 06L manages and directs the Ship Configuration and Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) process which supports the equipment Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) and logistics delivery processes throughout the Navy. Policy, implementation, operation and maintenance of all aspects of SCLSIS are provided in reference (c). (a) The SCLSIS process is used for Navy and Coast Guard automated and non-automated surface ships and submarines. SCLSIS also serves designated shore activities, such as Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) activities, Mobile Inshore Underwater Warfare Units (MIUWU), Moored Training Ships (MTS), Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Center (ASWOC) sites, Naval Training Facilities, and other Navy activities; and equipment system groups such as Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE), Navigational Aids and Landing Systems (NAALS), and Aegis systems.\\n\\nThe SCLSIS process allows ships to maintain an on-line source of their SCLSIS information allowing them to locate and determine configuration, logistics, and supply data associated with all installed equipment. This information can then be used to fill in MDS Maintenance Action Forms (OPNAV 4790/2K) and Configuration Change Forms (OPNAV 4790/CK) without having to refer to a series of manual or off-line reference books and files. The on-line system also allows the maintenance personnel to identify the repair parts associated with the equipment and systems that they are maintaining and to order these parts on-line. Since the configuration data in the OMMS–Next Generation (OMMS-NG) and Shipboard Non-tactical ADP Program (SNAP) databases is provided, the shipboard and unit personnel need only select the correct equipment and report the information relevant to the actual maintenance of the equipment. Supply and maintenance worthy equipment configuration changes must be reported and processed by the Configuration Data Manager (CDM).\\n\\nAutomated and non-automated units maintain a copy of their own configuration and logistics database. This database is the same as the unit\\'s section of the master CDMD-OA database. The two databases are kept in synchronization through the SCLSIS management process.\\n\\nConfiguration and Logistics Data.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(1) The accuracy of a unit’s configuration information affects the quality of the logistics support that the unit receives. Inaccurate data will result in the unit being supplied with incorrect component parts and technical documents, ultimately hindering battle damage repair efforts.\\n\\n(2) CDMD-OA is the source for configuration and logistic support data available to ships and other fleet and shore activities. This database also supports Class Maintenance Plan scheduling and refurbishment requirements and identifies all of the items, components, equipment, sub-assemblies, assemblies, sub-systems, and systems requiring integrated logistics support or planned maintenance requirements.\\n\\ne. Reporting. The 3-M System requires all afloat activities to report deferred and completed maintenance actions, configuration changes, and configuration file corrections. For information on COSAL feedback reporting, refer to reference (d), Afloat Supply Procedures. As directed by TYCOM or higher authority, shore activity 3-M Work Centers are to report corrective maintenance and configuration changes on all installed shipboard-identical equipment and equipment installed in service crafts and boats. One Work Candidate (OPNAV 4790/2K or equivalent) must be submitted for each job action. Do not bundle multiple equipment on one Work Candidate.\\n(2) CDMD-OA is the source for configuration and logistic support data available to ships and other fleet and shore activities.

One Work Candidate (OPNAV 4790/2K or equivalent) must be submitted for each job action. Do not bundle multiple equipment on one Work Candidate.\\n\\n(1) The configuration and maintenance forms used for manual reporting are the Configuration Change Form (OPNAV 4790/CK), the Maintenance Action Form (OPNAV 4790/2K), and the Supplemental Form (OPNAV 4790/2L.) Detailed instructions for completion of and examples of completed forms are found in reference (b), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19, Appendices G through I. Consult TYCOM directives for nuclear-specific CSMP procedures.\\n\\n(2) MDS automated data reporting is basically the same as in the non-automated 3-M program. The terms \"2K\", \"CK\", and “Work Candidate” are perpetuated in supporting software even though the paper forms are not filled out (with the exception of the Supplemental Form, OPNAV 4790/2L). Transactions are entered into the computer and reported up-line by using applicable software. Software instructions are developed and distributed by the 3-M Central Design Activities (CDA) and supplemented by TYCOM instructions as required. Options are available in the systems to print simulated OPNAV 4790/2K, OPNAV 4790/CK and Work Candidate forms when desired. Check the applicable system\\'s user manual or Online Help for additional information. Appendix C provides the data elements and allowed values (as applicable) for each type of automated report.\\n\\n(3) Ships are responsible for reporting equipment or component changes detected or accomplished by Ship\\'s Force and Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA). While the equipment Technical Authority is responsible for reporting Alteration Installation Team (AIT) installations, the ship is ultimately responsible for its own configuration accuracy. Fleet and TYCOM directives govern the AIT’s access to the ship’s MDS and these directives must be closely followed prior to allowing changes to occur. If these configuration changes have not been properly reported by the Technical Authority, the ship is responsible for reporting them.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nShipboard personnel report the configuration changes to the TYCOM via a completed Configuration Change Form (OPNAV 4790/CK).\\n\\nDate: 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(4) The Navy Supervising Activity (NSA) provides a certification of alteration accomplishment to the ship and the appropriate CDM when the shipyard has accomplished an installation. This certification includes the Work Center Job Sequence Number (JSN) assigned to the alteration and the Final Action taken. The certification will be in the format shown in Figure I-4-1. The ship must endorse the shipyard’s certification letter and forward to the support activity managing the ship’s Master CSMP. The endorsement provides authorization for information transmitted to be processed as completed deferrals in the Master CSMP. Refer to Figure I-4-2. This eliminates the need for documenting multiple configuration changes with multiple OPNAV 4790/CKs or 2K/Work Candidates to close the CSMP deferral. Configuration changes made by the depot in accomplishing the alterations are reported separately by the NSA to the CDM.\\n\\n(5) Reported maintenance action information is used for material history purposes and is the basis for the material and logistics support necessary to maintain equipment. Maintenance and material information in numerous reports and formats is available through the 3-M central database to any command requiring the information. These reports yield information concerning equipment maintainability and reliability, man-hour expenditures, material usage and costs, and material condition. Refer to Section III Chapter 1 of this instruction for information on obtaining 3-M data reports from NSLC.\\n\\nf. Work Candidate/JSN Log. The Work Candidate/JSN logs are used by all non-automated ships. The Work Center Supervisor (WCS) must maintain a Work Candidate/JSN Log as described in reference (b), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\ng. Screening and Submission Process.\\nConfiguration changes made by the depot in accomplishing the alterations are reported separately by the NSA to the CDM.\\n\\n(5) Reported maintenance action information is used for material history purposes and is the basis for the material and logistics support necessary to maintain equipment.

The Work Candidate/JSN logs are used by all non-automated ships. The Work Center Supervisor (WCS) must maintain a Work Candidate/JSN Log as described in reference (b), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\ng. Screening and Submission Process. All maintenance actions required to be documented by this instruction will be screened for accuracy and completeness. Any material requests that support a maintenance action must be assigned the identical JCN of that action and contain complete and accurate information. MDS documents, except supply documents, must be screened and transmitted off the ship as directed by TYCOM. Figure I-4-3 is an illustration of a sample letter of transmittal for 3-M documents submitted by non-automated activities to the supporting Automated Data Processing (ADP) facility. The timeliness of submission and the accuracy of the maintenance information reported are critical to the management of shipboard material deficiencies. The ship must have an up-to-date and useful CSMP showing the material condition of the ship for each Work Center. The CSMP provides the TYCOM with the means of determining urgent repairs for scheduling an IMA availability, shipyard overhaul, or a restricted availability.\\n\\nh. Transaction and Error Report. When information is entered into the computer at the supporting ADP facility, a Transaction and Error Identification Report is generated. A letter of transmittal will be generated and sent from the data processing activity to the originator for\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nReview and corrective action as necessary. The 3-M Coordinator is responsible for evaluating 17 Jun 2021 and resolving errors in the CSMP.\\n\\n Selected Level Reporting (SLR)\\n\\nSLR is a process that provides the capability for data collection of unique data elements in addition to the standard Work Candidate/2K submission. Designated SLR equipment may be either new or modified, proven to be unreliable, or require the collection of unique information to determine reliability. The NAVSEA 04RM SLR Technical Agent, NSLC Mechanicsburg, performs the development, maintenance and distribution function for SLR. SLR data that is collected is ultimately available in the Ships’ 3-M System via the Open Architectural Retrieval System (OARS).\\n\\n a. Selected Equipment Indicator (SEI)\\n\\n(1) The SEI resides in bop CDMD-OA, considered to be pe master database, and in pe shipboard equipment file. The value contained in pe SEI controls wheper an individual equipment record is regarded as an SLR record. If a given equipment file record contains an appropriate and specific SEI value, it determines which set of unique additional data elements will be displayed on an SLR template upon entering a Work Candidate/2-Kilo.\\n(2) NSLC Mechanicsburg maintains pe values in SEI via CDMD-OA. Changes to an SEI are accomplished by using unique Unit Identification Code (UIC)/Record Identification Number (RIN) combinations via special work-files (Item Type = SEI). The SEI is not updateable on pe CDMD-OA browse or detail screens. Only pe CDM is auporized to modify an SEI and does so by processing an “SEI” work-file created by NSLC Mechanicsburg.\\n(3) Any changes to an SEI in CDMD-OA automatically forwards a duplicate change transaction to pe applicable activity in order to keep pe values of SEI “in sync” between pe master database in CDMD-OA, and pe onboard equipment file.\\n\\n b. Selected Level Reporting Categories\\n\\nThe four distinct categories of SLR data are Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.\\n\\n(1) Level 1. In addition to pe basic Work Candidate/2-Kilo data entry requirements, Level 1 requires a mandatory data entry for bop “Active Maintenance Time” and “Trouble Isolation” during all completion entries. A “Meter Reading” entry is also desired on all completions of equipment designated Level 1 but is not mandatory.\\n(2) Level 2.\\n(3) Any changes to an SEI in CDMD-OA automatically forwards a duplicate change transaction to pe applicable activity in order to keep pe values of SEI “in sync” between pe master database in CDMD-OA, and pe onboard equipment file.\\n\\n b. Selected Level Reporting Categories\\n\\nThe four distinct categories of SLR data are Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.\\n\\n(1) Level 1. In addition to pe basic Work Candidate/2-Kilo data entry requirements, Level 1 requires a mandatory data entry for bop “Active Maintenance Time” and “Trouble Isolation” during all completion entries. A “Meter Reading” entry is also desired on all completions of equipment designated Level 1 but is not mandatory.\\n(2) Level 2. Level 2 requires pe basic Work Candidate/2-Kilo data entries, pe Level 1 mandatory data entries, additional unique data entries, and optional free-form data entries.\\n(a) Unique Data Elements\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nThis table outlines various fields related to maintenance activities, specifying which fields are mandatory and optional based on the type of activity.

Completion meter reading.\\n\\n(3) Level 3. SLR requires data entry for various unique data sets as defined by the requestor for each equipment designated as Level 3. Level 3 SLR utilizes a unique template for collection of the desired information within the applicable operating system whether it be the legacy SNAP or OMMS-NG. Subparagraphs 5.b.(3)(a) through 5.b.(3)(c) list examples of currently designated Level 3 SLR equipment:\\n\\n1. (a) Trident Command and Control Problem Reporting System – SEI is “C.”\\n2. (b) LM2500 Gas Turbine Engine – SEI is “L.”\\n3. (c) Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment Maintenance Program – SEI is “M.”\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(4) Level 4. Level 4 SLR was developed to meet the requirement to provide a more flexible SLR template. Level 4 provides the flexibility for the requestor to define the length of each data element for data collection and the maximum number of possible elements was expanded by nine. Level 4 also provides the requestor the capability to tailor the template layout as required. Level 4 will ultimately become the sole SLR template category serving as a replacement for all existing Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 categories. An example of a designated SLR Level 4 equipment is Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) AN/UYQ-70 Equipment which has an SEI of “A.”\\n\\nc. Level 3/Level 4 SLR Template. Unique Level 3 and Level 4 Specialized Reporting templates are created by NSLC Mechanicsburg and forwarded to applicable activities via a special software application within the CDMD-OA umbrella. The template serves as a data entry vehicle for the collection of additional information on specified SLR elements. SLR templates are forwarded and up-loaded to applicable activities via the standard ASI process.\\n\\nd. SLR Nominations, Deletions, and Changes.\\n\\n1. A TYCOM, SYSCOM, or designated ISEA normally originate nominations for adding equipment to the SLR program, requests for deleting equipment from the SLR program, requests for changing either Level 3 or Level 4 templates, and requests for changing the SEI settings. If originated by a TYCOM, the request should be submitted via the cognizant SYSCOM or ISEA exercising technical control over the equipment. If originated by a SYSCOM or ISEA, the SYSCOM is responsible for obtaining formal concurrence of all TYCOMs having units affected by the change prior to submitting the request.\\n2. NAVSEA 04RM must approve all SLR nominations, deletions, and changes.\\n3. Nomination requests for an equipment to be added to SLR should include the information listed in subparagraphs 5.d.(3)(a) through 5.d.(3)(f):\\n\\nJustification of the need for adding the equipment to SLR.\\n4. Evidence the fleet has the capability to input the requested unique data.\\n5. A statement confirming that necessary resources are available and budgeted to perform the in-depth analysis of MDS data on the nominated equipment.\\n6.

For assistance contact Navy 311 at 1-855-NAVY-311 and ask to speak with a NSLC Mechanicsburg SLR representative.\\n\\ng. Three-year Limitation. As a general rule equipment will automatically be removed from SLR after a period of three years. Every effort will be made to notify the originating requestor as the three-year limit is approaching. NSLC Mechanicsburg will request the nominator submit a justification for retention of the equipment in the SLR program. Equipment can be deleted upon making a request to NSLC Mechanicsburg at any time during the three-year period when it has been determined that sufficient information has been collected.\\n\\nh. Semiannual Update. SYSCOMs having technical control of specific SLR equipment are strongly urged to provide applicable TYCOMs and Fleet Commanders with a semiannual update outlining the status of SLR data collection efforts, the status of identified problems with possible solutions, and a plan of action for resolution of problems. SYSCOMs are responsible for informing applicable TYCOMs and Fleet Commanders if the SLR data is not being received. If data is not being received, the SYSCOM should provide both the TYCOM and Fleet Commanders an in-depth analysis of why data is not being received and recommend either the equipment continue as an SLR item or be deleted.\\n\\n Current Ship\\'s Maintenance Project\\n\\nThe purpose of the CSMP is to provide unit and activity maintenance managers with a consolidated list of deferred maintenance to identify the material condition of the ship.\\n\\n4-9\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nReference (b), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19, provides an in-depth discussion of the CSMP, 17 Jun 2021 TYCOM specific requirements, usage and available reports.\\n\\n Shipboard Assessment of MDS Performance\\n\\nThe Commanding Officer is ultimately responsible for the performance of MDS at their command.

Purpose\\n\\nTo provide NAVSEA policy concerning the use and implementation of NAVY maintenance scheduling software, SKED.\\n\\n 2. Scope\\n\\nThis chapter applies to all activities and commands utilizing SKED Version 3.2 or higher.\\n\\n 3. Policy\\n\\nThe use of SKED version 3.2 or higher for PMS scheduling constitutes full compliance with all administrative provisions of this manual. Guidance for the use of SKED 3.2 is provided via reference (a) and (b), Help menus, Wizards, instructor-led activation training, and embedded Computer-Based Training. NAVSEA authorizes the use of references (a) and (b) as governing documents for the implementation and use of SKED.\\n\\n 4. Conversion SKED 3.1 to SKED 3.2\\n\\nAll SKED 3.1 users are being migrated to SKED 3.2. Reference (b) provides guidance and direction for installing this upgrade.\\n\\n 5. SKED User Roles\\n\\nSKED 3.2 contains default user roles that support Command 3-M Organization and Responsibilities described in reference (c), Vol. VI, Chapter 19. The TYCOM may change default roles for customized management of the 3-M program. Default roles include the following:\\n\\n(1) 3-M Coordinator\\n(2) Department Head\\n(3) Division Officer\\n(4) Leading Chief Petty Officer (LCPO)\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(5) Work Center Supervisor (WCS)\\n\\n(6) Maintenance Personnel (designated as Crew Members in SKED fields)\\n\\n(7) Administrator\\n\\n(8) Read-Only (for inspectors and observers)\\n\\nb. The 3-M Coordinator will assign the default permissions and viewable content for each user account. Permissions are based upon a user’s role and position in the chain of command. Users may determine their role from the MY TASKS view of SKED.\\n\\n SKED User Interface\\n\\na. SKED consists of functional areas whereby data is presented within a modular layout of grids, tables, and outlines. Each functional area or “view” consists of a custom menu, sorting features, toolbar(s), Help tool, status bar, and icon legend. Most views have secondary views that further define functionality. Each view is independent of other views.\\n\\nb. Users will log on to the system with a username and password or registered Common Access Card (CAC). User activity such as acknowledging, signing, or generating information becomes part of the automated PMS workflows that are built into the system. Through these automated workflows, the chain of command may track actions for accountability purposes.\\n\\n Equipment-Based PMS Schedules\\n\\nPMS schedules are dynamic, meaning they automatically change according to ship evolutions, equipment status, situational events, and other maintenance requirements. PMS schedules are equipment-based and centered on the use and organization of Maintenance Items and Maintenance Groups. Equipment-based schedules enable the WCS to forecast man-hours, checks, tools, parts, materials, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), and test equipment.\\n\\na. Maintenance Items. Maintenance Items are defined as any piece of equipment, sub-equipment, system, or subsystem requiring maintenance. Therefore, all PMS-worthy equipment must be identified as Maintenance Items. Each Maintenance Item has unique MRC relationships which show how many MRC procedures are appropriate and required for each item. The schedule provides data pertaining to each Maintenance Item such as title, serial number, location, nomenclature, maintenance procedure(s), and note block.\\n\\nb. Maintenance Groups. Maintenance Groups organize Maintenance Items under like categories. Supervisors will create and use groups as an organizational tool for managing maintenance; however, Maintenance Groups do not directly affect the PMS schedule.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n 8.\\nEquipment-based schedules enable the WCS to forecast man-hours, checks, tools, parts, materials, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), and test equipment.\\n\\na.

True Interval Scheduling\\n\\nSKED uses a calculated scheduling interval by periodicity from the last scheduled instance of an MRC. This true interval scheduling maintains proper periodicity between scheduled maintenance tasks.\\n\\n- a. Scheduling rules revolve around a specific number of days. Weekly checks are performed every 7 days; monthly checks every 31 days; quarterly checks every 91 days; and so on. Time intervals are maintained and future maintenance is automatically rescheduled based on the interval established when a maintenance task was originally scheduled.\\n- b. When Supervisors add or reschedule PMS, future occurrences of the check will adjust accordingly to maintain proper periodicity.\\n- c. Supervisors are not allowed to manually reschedule checks that are out of periodicity. If maintenance is not performed, the check is moved to the next week on the schedule when the Work Center is closed out for the week. If a maintenance task goes out of periodicity, a PMS alert will be generated when a weekly closeout is performed. An automated workflow sends the PMS alert to the chain of command. At this time, the WCS must provide a reason why maintenance was not performed on time.\\n- d. True Interval scheduling keeps the sailor from repeating maintenance that was just performed, and always maintains the proper number of days between checks. If an unscheduled check such as an M-1R occurs a week before an M-1R that is already on the schedule, SKED 3.2 automatically moves the next M-1R to 31 days after the M-1R is performed.\\n\\n 9. Schedule Preparation\\n\\nThe Navy PMS DVDs are the primary source of data for SKED. The DVDs contain the List of Effective Pages (LOEP) with all MIPs and MRCs associated to a specific command, unit and Work Center. For every Force Revision (FR), the PMS DVD is loaded into SKED, ensuring the software has the most current data available for preparing PMS schedules.\\n\\n- a. Overview. PMS schedule is built for a collection of Maintenance Items. When building a new Work Center, the WCS must first identify Maintenance Items. Proper identification of Maintenance Items will result in accurate scheduling and optimal SKED functionality. Once established, Work Center schedules will be updated automatically each quarter when PMS documents are directly imported as part of the FR process.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nb. PMS Organization. Most organizational outlines in SKED 3.2 are as follows: Maintenance Index pages (MIPs), Maintenance Groups, Maintenance Items, and Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRCs).\\n\\n- (1) MIPs.\\nMIPs are the broadest unit of organization of PMS documents. Each MIP represents coverage for a system, subsystem, component, or a category of components. The PMS DVD containing the LOEP with associated MIPs and electronic PMS documents are imported into SKED. To prepare PMS schedules, the WCS will use this data to perform the following:\\n\\n- (a) Accept the MIP if it applies to the Work Center and add to the schedule.\\n- (b) If the MIP does not apply to a Maintenance Item in the Work Center, provide a Feedback Report to ensure the MIP is removed from the LOEP during the next update process. If shifting maintenance responsibilities, follow the guidelines outlined in Reference (b), Vol VI, Chapter 19.\\n- (2) Maintenance Items.\\nWhen building a PMS schedule, the WCS must first define and organize Maintenance Items into like items. Maintenance Items must be created first because they directly affect the schedule. Maintenance Groups do not affect the schedule despite being placed higher in the organizational outline. Maintenance Items will be identified by their relation to a MIP from the OMMS Ship’s equipment configuration list.\\nTo prepare PMS schedules, the WCS will use this data to perform the following:\\n\\n- (a) Accept the MIP if it applies to the Work Center and add to the schedule.\\n- (b) If the MIP does not apply to a Maintenance Item in the Work Center, provide a Feedback Report to ensure the MIP is removed from the LOEP during the next update process. If shifting maintenance responsibilities, follow the guidelines outlined in Reference (b), Vol VI, Chapter 19.\\n- (2) Maintenance Items.\\nWhen building a PMS schedule, the WCS must first define and organize Maintenance Items into like items. Maintenance Items must be created first because they directly affect the schedule. Maintenance Groups do not affect the schedule despite being placed higher in the organizational outline. Maintenance Items will be identified by their relation to a MIP from the OMMS Ship’s equipment configuration list. If a Maintenance Item is not listed on the configuration list, the WCS may create unique Maintenance Item(s) based on title, serial number, and location. After ensuring the Maintenance Items are organized correctly, the WCS will add them to the schedule.\\n- (3) MRCs.\\nWhen adding Maintenance Items to the schedule, the WCS will review MRCs to determine how the MRC is used in relation to the development of Maintenance Items and Maintenance Groups. The WCS needs to decide whether the MRC procedure applies to one item, and is then repeated in its entirety on multiple, identical items, such as “Inspect Battle Lantern,” or, the MRC procedure is performed on a system, subsystem, equipment, or sub-equipment, such as “Isolate the fire main to the compartment.” The WCS will also conduct the following:\\n\\n- (a) Perform a “review and omit” process on the procedural steps to eliminate the risk of execution errors. With SKED, this process is automated through electronic procedure line-outs, which are then approved by the Division LCPO. The procedure will then be customized for the Maintenance Item. Discrepancies in procedural steps other than those outlined in reference (c) Vol VI, Chapter 19 must be documented with an FBR.\\n- (b) Review the MIPs to determine if Related Maintenance must also be performed. The related MRC must be linked to the parent MRC on the schedule. Mandatory-Related Maintenance procedures, indicated by a # symbol on the MIP, will be automatically scheduled together for the life of the Work Center.\\n\\n6-4\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(4) Maintenance Groups. After identifying Maintenance Items and reviewing MRCs, the WCS will organize Maintenance Items into like Maintenance Groups. Create a single Maintenance Group at a time. The groups will serve only as a management tool to better organize schedules and displays, they do not affect the schedule.\\n\\n(5) Assign Maintenance Personnel. Crew members are assigned to Work Centers to produce a talent pool from which the WCS can assign PMS tasks. Supervisors may add or remove crew members as needed utilizing any display in the WORK CENTER view.\\n\\n SKED Views\\n\\nThe permissions assigned to an individual’s User ID will determine the Views that will be visible in SKED. The available Views will be displayed on the View Tab Bar at the bottom of the window.\\n\\n a. MY TASKS.\\n\\nMaintenance personnel must check the MY TASKS tab (Tasks view) upon each use of SKED. Personnel are responsible for performing maintenance tasks that are assigned to them and can determine assignments from MY TASKS. The function provides specific, user-oriented instructions regarding maintenance tasks awaiting action, Unit PMS Messages sent by the 3-M Coordinator, notices of sub-standard metrics, and notices of triggered global events affecting a Work Center. It also identifies Work Centers with FRs past due. Reference (a) provides additional guidance.\\n\\n b. WORKCENTER.\\n\\nThe purpose of the WORKCENTER view is to create, maintain, and document the Work Center’s maintenance. Most of the actions here are completed by a WCS. The initial display of the WORKCENTER lists all of the command’s Work Centers. The Chain of Command (CoC) must review the maintenance activity being performed in the Work Centers to determine current maintenance status. The WORKCENTER View is divided into seven separate displays: Schedule, Review, Forecast, Situational Events, IEM (Inactive Equipment Maintenance), Journal, and PMS Documents. A Work Center must be opened to access these displays. Reference (a) provides additional guidance.\\n\\n(1) Weekly Closeouts. After weekly maintenance tasks have been completed, the WCS must perform the function known as “weekly closeout”. The weekly closeout facilitates computation of PMS accomplishment data and generation of reports relative to maintenance status.\\nReference (a) provides additional guidance.\\n\\n b.

The weekly closeout facilitates computation of PMS accomplishment data and generation of reports relative to maintenance status. The closeouts become part of the ship’s PMS data; they will be date/time stamped and electronic signatures will be recorded. If a maintenance task goes out of periodicity, a PMS alert will be generated when a weekly closeout is performed. The Supervisor must enter the reason why maintenance was not performed on time. The reason will be reviewed and approved/disapproved by the Division Officer.\\n\\n c. PMS VIEWER.\\n\\nThe PMS VIEWER allows you to view and print Maintenance Index Pages (MIPs) and Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRCs) that are distributed on the PMS.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nDVD. The PMS Viewer in SKED is meant to replicate the same functionality as the DVD PMS Viewer application. This functionality allows the user to:\\n\\n- (1) Display various MIP and MRC documents.\\n- (2) Search for PMS documents by SYSCOM control number or nomenclature.\\n- (3) Print PMS documents individually.\\n- (4) Batch print multiple PMS documents.\\n- (5) View by current Command or all Unit Identification Codes (UICs).\\n\\nThe documents displayed in the DVD PMS Viewer are reference documents and therefore not customized for a Work Center or a specific piece of equipment. To view customized PMS documents, use the PMS Documents section of the WORKCENTER view. Reference (a) provides additional guidance.\\n\\nd. FBR.\\n\\n1. The Feedback Report Manager (FBR on the view tab bar) provides an organized way to view PMS Feedback Reports, both technical and non-technical. Reference (a) provides additional guidance. Reports can be viewed in four different ways:\\n\\nList by Quarter.\\n2. List by Work Center.\\n3. List by Originator.\\n4. List by Status.\\n\\nEach list contains the same information, but the lists are organized differently to suit need or preference. Depending on the user’s permissions, the following tasks can be performed:\\n\\nView FBR details.\\nCreate new FBRs.\\nDelete old FBRs.\\nPrint FBRs and details.\\nPerform quick and advanced searches.\\n\\n6-6\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(f) Export approved FBRs.\\n\\n(g) Change feedback preferences.\\n\\ne. SPMIG. The Standard PMS Material Identification Guide Viewer (SPMIG on the view tab bar) enables you to access and search the tools, parts, and materials databases used with MRC documents. This information may be useful for ordering repair parts, gathering test equipment information, or checking if an item is out of stock on the ship. The following can be performed:\\n\\n- Perform a quick search of the SPMIG database.\\n- Perform an advanced search of the SPMIG database.\\n- View and print SPMIG record details.\\n- Print search result lists.\\n- Reference (a), the SKED 3.2 Users Guide, Chapter 9, provides additional guidance.\\n\\nf. SPOT CHECKS. SKED features a separate SPOT CHECKS view. Spots checks assess performance of planned maintenance procedures. Leaders in the CoC may spot check various pieces of equipment in any given Work Center, which gives them a completion confidence factor. The two types of spot checks are:\\n\\n- Spot Check. This type of check assesses maintenance that was previously performed.\\n- Monitored MRC. This type of check is a real-time assessment but does not earn a recorded score (SCAR).\\n- Reference (a) provides SKED guidance; reference (c), Vol VI, Chapter 19 provides TYCOM requirements.\\n\\ng. TRAINING. SKED 3.2.4 features embedded, interactive and narrated training. From the TRAINING view, several training courses can be accessed, which are called circuits. Each circuit is comprised of a series of sports themed lessons.\\nf. SPOT CHECKS. SKED features a separate SPOT CHECKS view. Spots checks assess performance of planned maintenance procedures. Leaders in the CoC may spot check various pieces of equipment in any given Work Center, which gives them a completion confidence factor. The two types of spot checks are:\\n\\n- Spot Check. This type of check assesses maintenance that was previously performed.\\n- Monitored MRC. This type of check is a real-time assessment but does not earn a recorded score (SCAR).\\n- Reference (a) provides SKED guidance; reference (c), Vol VI, Chapter 19 provides TYCOM requirements.\\n\\ng. TRAINING. SKED 3.2.4 features embedded, interactive and narrated training. From the TRAINING view, several training courses can be accessed, which are called circuits. Each circuit is comprised of a series of sports themed lessons. For SKED 3.2.5 and later, video tutorials replaced the embedded training. Reference (a), provides additional guidance.\\n\\nh. LOEP. The List of Effected Pages (LOEP) Manager (LOEP on the view tab bar) indicates the current Work Centers, MIPs, and MRCs being implemented in SKED. For MIP and MRC documents, the LOEP Manager also provides the number of Maintenance Items that use the specified MIP or MRC (Count). The LOEP Manager has two displays: the Workcenter List View and the MIP List View. Both lists have two panes (sections). The left pane has the outline view of the Command. The right pane lists data applicable to a selected item from the outline view. Reference (a), provides additional guidance.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\ni. EVENTS. SKED has two functional areas that must be used when managing situational maintenance: Global Events Manager (EVENTS view) and the Situational display (secondary display in the WORK CENTER view). The 3-M Coordinator must use the Global Events Manager (EVENTS view) to view and update the ship’s schedule. The EVENTS view is similar to the Situational display, but only events that affect the whole ship are displayed. Reference (a), provides additional guidance.\\n\\n(1) Content of the EVENTS View. This view is comprised of a full-screen calendar that spans one year: one past quarter, the current quarter, and two future quarters. All events, both states and triggers, are shown on this calendar. All states on the calendar are color-coded. Blue signifies “At Sea.” Gray signifies “In Port.” Yellow signifies any other type of state.\\n\\n(2) Use of the EVENTS View. The 3-M Coordinator must establish the event title, define the event, assign offsets, and perform the following actions:\\n\\n- (a) Update a global state.\\n- (b) Remove a global state.\\n- (c) Add a global trigger.\\n- (d) Remove a global trigger.\\n\\nj. REPORTS. The REPORTS view allows reports to be run in SKED such as Assigned PMS, Customized MRCs, Feedback Reports, Forecasting, Situational Events, Training, and much more. This view also allows a user to Import activity-specific reports and Export Reports as necessary. Reference (a), provides additional guidance.\\n\\nk. ADMIN. SKED Administration (ADMIN on the view tab bar) is a management tool. Not all users have a visible ADMIN tab on their screen. User roles dictate this permission. The ADMIN view features the following secondary displays:\\n\\n- (1) User Management.\\n- (2) Chain of Command.\\n- (3) Accomplishment Ratings.\\n- (4) Weekly Closeout Status.\\n- (5) Training Manager.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(6) Transaction Log.\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nIn addition to these secondary displays, you can access the SKED Preferences tool from the Admin menu. Reference (a), provides additional guidance.\\n\\n11. Revision Editor\\n\\nPerforming correct revisions of PMS schedules is a critical step in the 3-M System. An error may result in severe scheduling consequences. Therefore, particular attention must be given to every revision created in SKED. The Revision Editor provides the framework for an accurate schedule. By utilizing the Revision Editor, the WCS may change the PMS requirements for their Work Center, such as inconsistencies between maintenance requirements and the quantity of Maintenance Items needed for each task. Supervisors may also change their Work Center’s structure, including MIP, Maintenance Group, Maintenance Item, or MRC relationships.\\n\\na. Types of Revisions. The WCS will be able to make the following revisions utilizing SKED:\\n\\n- (1) Advance Change Notice (ACN).\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nIn addition to these secondary displays, you can access the SKED Preferences tool from the Admin menu.

The WCS will be able to make the following revisions utilizing SKED:\\n\\n- (1) Advance Change Notice (ACN). ACN revisions permit rapid responses to technical difficulties encountered in the fleet’s use of a MIP or MRC. ACNs may change the PMS schedule.\\n- (2) Document/Information Transmittal (DIT). DIT revisions forward new or superseded PMS documentation between Force Revisions. DITs also provide PMS information and narrative replies to non-technical FBRs. They are addressed to 3-M Coordinators to ensure accountability and disposition of PMS information.\\n- (3) Feedback Report (FBR). FBR revisions result when the UIC receives a response to an FBR that requires Work Center changes.\\n- (4) Force Revision (FR). Force Revisions are periodic updates to installed PMS documentation. FRs are distributed on the PMS DVD and imported to SKED to keep data accurate. SKED will compare the current reference data from the PMS DVD against a given Work Center schedule.\\n- (5) Administrative (Admin). Admin revisions correct administrative inconsistencies with the Work Center PMS schedule that are not covered by the other four types of revisions.\\n\\nb. Chapter 2, Paragraph 4 and 6 of this manual and reference (a), provide guidance concerning the implementation of the above listed revisions.\\n\\n6-9\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n12. Accomplishment Ratings\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nAccomplishment ratings in SKED 3.2 differ significantly from SKED 3.1. The Accomplishment Ratings displayed in the ADMIN View provide details of four metrics. These metrics include:\\n\\n- Periodic Accomplishment Ratings (PAR), Situational Accomplishment Ratings (SAR), Administration Accomplishment Ratings (AAR), and Spot Check Accomplishment Ratings (SCAR).\\n\\na. PAR measures the percentage of checks performed within periodicity. PAR factors PMS Alerts and lost checks.\\n\\nb. SKED knows when global situations occur and SAR is a calculation of the accomplishment of that maintenance.\\n\\nc. AAR keeps track of administration duties such as checking weekly close-out status, signing Feedback Reports (FBR), acknowledging PMS alerts, and approving MRC lineouts.\\n\\nd. SCAR measures the number of satisfactory checks divided by the total number of spot checks. SCAR provides administrators and inspectors a confidence rating that reflects how well the Command is performing maintenance.\\n\\nReference (c), Vol VI, Chapter 19 provides in-depth guidance and background concerning Assessments and Accomplishment Ratings.\\n\\n13. Tailored Force Revision\\n\\nThe Tailored Force Revision (TFR) initiative was developed to reduce the administrative burden on Ship’s Force personnel when installing a PMS Force Revision. The program has evolved from a TYCOM sponsored effort to a NAVSEA 04 authorized and sustained initiative. TFR currently applies to all surface ships and most recently has been expanded to cover submarine assets. TFR packages are assembled on the standard FR cycle, using current ship PMS schedules from SKED and provide pre-processed PMS documentation to give the WCS a significant head start in processing an FR. TFR is basically maintenance experts ashore assisting a WCS with the administration of their FR.\\n\\nTFR brings PMS, configuration, and ship’s PMS schedules together for the first time, along with a dedicated team of professionals whose entire job is focused on identifying changes to PMS, configuration, and how it applies to the Fleet. WCSs are provided, in conjunction with the standard FR, a separate tailored FR disk that contains pre-processed FR data to import into SKED. It also comes with an Applied List of Effected Pages (LOEP) report that shows document and schedule changes. The Applied LOEP report also flags items for review. In addition, the TFR comes with summary reports highlighting anomalies for the WCS and 3MC.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\na.

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter describes Maintenance and Material Management (3-M) related actions required prior to, during, and following an inspection conducted by the Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV).\\n\\n2. INSURV Mission\\n\\nINSURV was established by Congress as a board to periodically examine naval vessels and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy if any should be stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Per references (a) and (b), INSURV has been tasked with added specific functions including the following:\\n\\n- a. Determining a vessel\\'s fitness for further service.\\n- b. Identifying material conditions that limit performance, and compiling statistical information.\\n- c. Providing assurance to higher authority that mechanisms to identify, document, and resolve material deficiencies are adequate and that these systems are being judiciously executed.\\n\\nThe examination of naval vessels is conducted as a Material Inspection (MI), which consists of operational tests or demonstrations of major systems and equipment. The formative basis for the MI is a command’s own self-awareness to its material condition and readiness. It is therefore incumbent upon each command being inspected to demonstrate a thorough knowledge of its material condition through accurate records and operational demonstrations.\\n\\n3. INSURV Documentation Procedures\\n\\nPer reference (b), Ship\\'s Force should review the preparation guidelines available at INSURV\\'s homepage: https://usff.navy.deps.mil/sites/insurv/Inspections/Pages/Home.aspx. The ship being inspected will prepare material deficiency documents as directed within reference (c).\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nINSURV Board prepares material deficiency documents to record conditions found during the 17 Jun 2021 inspection using PRESINSURV Inspection Management System (PRISMS). Deficiencies will be cataloged on Maintenance Action Forms (OPNAV/2K), or \"2-Kilos,\" to be reviewed and later input into the Maintenance Data System (MDS). Specifically, for those 2 Kilos being created by INSURV:\\n\\n- a. BLOCK 1, UIC will be entered globally.\\n- b. Using Ship Configuration and Logistic Information System (SCLSIS) data, the elements listed in subparagraphs 3.b.(1) through 3.b.(9) will be entered programmatically via selection of the Record Identification Number (RIN) for the deficient Configuration Item (CI) – one CI per Maintenance Action (OPNAV/2K):\\n- (1) BLOCK 2, Work Center\\n- (2) BLOCK 4, Allowance Parts List (APL)\\n- (3) BLOCK 13, ID/Serial Number\\n- (4) BLOCK 14, Equipment Identification Code (EIC)\\n- (5) BLOCK 16, Location\\n- (6) BLOCK 5, Equipment Noun Name\\n- (7) Hierarchical Structure Code (HSC)\\n- (8) RIN\\n- (9) Positional Reference Identification (PRID)\\n- c.

If a configuration item has an existing Maintenance Action (OPNAV/2K), INSURV will create a new OPNAV/2K if the observed symptoms are significantly different from that already reported. The new OPNAV/2K will reference the existing OPNAV/2K JSN.\\n\\n Procedures Before INSURV Inspection\\n\\na. Ship Responsibilities. The specific actions of the Commanding Officer and Ship\\'s Force are noted in reference (c). The INSURV inspection provides an opportunity for the ship to demonstrate a high material self-awareness as reflected in accurate documentation of its deficient conditions, such as in the CSMP and on Casualty Reports (CASREP.) The ship\\'s 3-M Coordinator and Work Center Supervisors should routinely be reviewing work candidates. Those that are old should be verified as still valid; those that appear to be duplicates should be considered for removal or combining, and those for which repairs have been completed should be closed out and removed from the CSMP. Additionally, equipment Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are expected to be current and easily executed when called upon by board members.\\n\\nb. Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC). Specific actions are denoted within reference (c). The ISIC must pay particular attention to ensuring that the mechanisms to identify, document and correct material deficiencies identified by Ship\\'s Force or others are accurately reflected within the CSMP. Additionally, the ISIC should ensure that deficiencies are being continuously prosecuted and adjudicated with the appropriate priority and assignment.\\n\\n Deficiencies to be Reported\\n\\nPer reference (c), the CSMP is \"the sole source of work to be accomplished by industrial activities, FMAs, and organizational level activities\" and therefore should reflect the deficient material items requiring maintenance action. Reference (c) outlines expected items to be noted within the CSMP.\\n\\n Procedures During INSURV Inspection\\n\\nDocumentation of INSURV inspection deficiencies will be accomplished per reference (c).\\n\\n INSURV Numbering Procedures\\n\\nINSURV will assign a unique tracking number to deficiencies identified during the inspection. Subparagraphs 7.a. through 7.f. describe the content of blocks 19 through 24 of the\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nMaintenance Action Form (OPNAV 4790/2K). The INSURV number is assigned to each deficiency identified during an inspection or trial to uniquely identify a deficiency, indicate the relative importance of a deficiency, identify special classes of deficiencies and specify the required time for correction of a deficiency. See Figure II-1-1.\\nThis table contains information related to INSURV NUMBER, with columns for different attributes such as S and R/M.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nINSURV Number Table,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- 19.*: None\\n- 20.INSURV NUMBER: None\\n- 21.: None\\n- 22.: None\\n- 23.S: None\\n- 24.

Asterisks (stars) designate a completion requirement and are used on Acceptance Trials (AT), Final Contract Trials (FCT), Integrated Trials (IT), Combined Trials (CT), and Guarantee Material Inspections (GMI).\\n\\n(1) Single Starred Deficiencies: (*). A deficiency which, in INSURV\\'s judgment, requires resolution or waiver by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) before the ship is delivered to the Navy and which:\\n\\n- (a) Significantly degrades a ship\\'s ability to perform an assigned primary or secondary Mission Essential Task (MET).\\n- (b) Prevents the crew from safely operating or maintaining ship systems.\\n- (c) Prevents the crew from safely living or messing onboard.\\n- (d) Precludes safe navigation, effective damage control or firefighting operations, or adequate physical security.\\n- (e) Prevents the ship from complying with environmental or Navy Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) regulations.\\n\\n(2) Double Starred Deficiencies: (**). A deficiency applicable only to ships constructed, converted, or modernized with a separate fitting-out period assigned away from the building site, and represents a deficiency which, in INSURV\\'s judgment, requires resolution or waiver by the CNO prior to the ship\\'s departure from the building yard.\\n\\nb. Block 20 - INSURV Identification Number. The seven spaces of this block are filled in as seen in Figure II-1-2:\\nThis table represents a set of data with 7 columns and 7 rows.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTable 1: Data Set,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- 1: None\\n- K: None\\n- 0: None\\n- 0: None\\n- 1: None\\n- H: None\\n- B: None\\n\\nThis table represents a set of data with 7 columns and 7 rows.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTable 1: Data Set,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- 1: None\\n- K: None\\n- 0: None\\n- 0: None\\n- 1: None\\n- H: None\\n- B: None\\n\\n|1|K|0|0.1|1.1|H|B|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|\\n\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(1) Importance (Space One).

Cause injury to personnel or damage to vital material. This includes significant deficiencies to pe ship\\'s safety equipment and devices. These deficiencies are documented as a \"Safety\" wip an assigned RAC.\\n\\n(b) PART 2. Deficiencies that do not meet the criteria for a PART 1 deficiency, but should be corrected to restore the ship to required specifications. These can include safety-related issues.\\n\\n(c) PART 3. Deficiencies that in the inspector\\'s judgment will require either a major alteration to correct, or modifications that are too costly to accomplish during the life cycle of the ship (i.e., passageway too narrow, overhead too low, insufficient equipment). These are documented to identify design changes required on future ships. These deficiencies are generally coded \"9\" in Block 45 (TYCOM SCREENING) and passed to machinery history files. The deficiency will appear on the INSURV deficiency list. PART 3 deficiencies also include documented demonstration deficiencies. This information is used by INSURV for statistical analysis or for documentation purposes.\\n\\n(2) Responsibility (Space Two). The single capital letter \"K\", \"G,\" or \"A\" is used to indicate responsibility for corrective action.

Alteration Cards should include recommendations for how correction can be accomplished either by referencing a previously engineered alteration or by detailing possible corrective action in the remarks section. A PART 3 Alteration Card (\"3A\") indicates a change that might be beneficial to the ship, but because of the ship’s age or other consideration is unlikely to be accomplished or is low priority. A PART 3 Alteration Card (\"3A\") could indicate an area where an older ship does not comply with current specification, standards or instructions, but that the effort to engineer and install the required changes are unlikely due to cost or other factors. INSURV expects that a \"3A\" deficiency will be passed to history without action on the ship being inspected.\\n\\n1. Sequential Number (Space 3, 4, and 5). This is a sequential number or alphanumeric assigned to each deficiency by INSURV which, along with the department code, uniquely identifies each deficiency.\\n2. Department (Space 6 and 7).

Introduction\\n\\nThe Ships\\' 3-M System enhances force readiness and helps identify material problems. Type Commanders (TYCOMs) and shore commands performing TYCOM functions (i.e., Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC), Marine Corps Installations East (MCI-E), Marine Corps Installations West (MCI-W), Marine Corps Bases Pacific (MARCORBASES PAC), etc.) are responsible for ensuring that each command under their cognizance effectively uses the 3-M System. When the 3-M System is effectively used, a higher degree of equipment readiness will be achieved. Through inspections of the 3-M System and assist visits, TYCOMs, or ISICs under TYCOM direction, can recognize problems the command may be having in effectively identifying, scheduling, performing, and documenting maintenance actions. For problems identified, corrective action can then be initiated. Each TYCOM (or ISIC under TYCOM direction) will establish, train, and maintain a team of qualified 3-M System Coordinators or Representatives responsible for:\\n\\n- a. Monitoring PMS installations.\\n- b. Providing assistance when requested.\\n- c. Performing 3-M Inspections.\\n\\n2. Assist Visits\\n\\n- a. The TYCOM must schedule assist visits to each ship or shore activity as requested. The purpose of an assist visit is to aid command 3-M Managers in determining how efficiently their 3-M program is operating, and help identify potential problem areas. The assist team will respond appropriately to identify the areas that need attention and the type of assistance required. An assist visit is instructional and provides training and assistance to the requesting activity.\\n- b. Assistance in the form of briefings or group discussions must be provided to clarify any problems that become apparent during an assist visit. Each assist visit must include a debriefing with the Commanding Officer prior to concluding the visit. These assist visits will include advice concerning management of the Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and Maintenance Data System (MDS), as well as advice regarding other significant 3-M System problems.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n3. TYCOM / ISIC Inspections - 17 Jun 2021\\n\\na. The purpose of an inspection is to determine the effectiveness of the command\\'s 3-M program in managing the accomplishment of maintenance. A TYCOM (or ISIC under TYCOM direction) inspection is a comprehensive audit of the Ships\\' 3-M Program. Emphasis is to be given to the effectiveness of maintenance management and maintenance accomplishment. Included in the inspection will be the adequacy of the PMS installation and the effectiveness of the shipboard 3-M training program.\\n\\nb. The TYCOM (or ISIC under TYCOM direction) must conduct a complete inspection of each command under their cognizance, per the requirements of reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\nc. The procedures and criteria in reference (a), JFMM, Volume VI, Chapter 19 must be used to ensure standardization of the measurement of 3-M program performance, and to enhance communications at all levels of command.\\n\\n4. PMS Inspection\\n\\nProper accomplishment of PMS is critical to maintaining acceptable equipment performance levels required in today\\'s tactical environment. Additionally, personnel and environmental safety is paramount in conducting routine preventive maintenance. It is the Commanding Officer\\'s responsibility to ensure the PMS objectives, listed in subparagraphs 4.a through 4.c are met per Fleet and TYCOM directives.\\n\\na. Ensure PMS performed matches the installed equipment.\\n\\nb. Ensure PMS completed was done correctly following the MRC. \"Correctly\" includes but is not limited to the accomplishment of subparagraphs 4.b.(1) through 4.b.(4):\\n\\n- (1) Safety precautions were observed.\\n- (2) Proper tools and materials were used.\\n- (3) Tag out procedures were correct when applicable.\\n- (4) If Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) was used, appropriate personal protective equipment was used and in good material condition.

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter provides an overview of NAVSEA and Performance Monitoring Team (PMT) functions and responsibilities as they apply to the submarine Performance Monitoring Program (PMP) and the program’s interface with the Maintenance and Material Management (3-M) program.\\n\\n2. Objective\\n\\na. The Submarine PMP was established by the Chief of Naval Operations, per reference (a), as a method of collecting objective engineering evidence of ship system performance. This data was then used to:\\n\\n- (1) Allow the extension of shipyard overhauls.\\n- (2) Extend operational cycles.\\n- (3) Extend the useful life of the vessels.\\n- (4) Align major maintenance.\\n\\nb. While this mission is still applicable today with the PMTs ensuring safe and reliable Extension of Operating Cycles (EOCs), the maintenance has also evolved into using Conditioned Based Maintenance (CBM) techniques to assess the performance of many critical submarine systems, primarily, submarine Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) systems.\\n\\n3. Responsibilities\\n\\na. NAVSEA SEA05U7. The offices of NAVSEA 05U7 provide the technical oversight, technical documentation, requirements, and analysis for the PMP while programmatic oversight is provided by NAVSEA In-service Submarine Program Office (PMS392).\\n\\nb. Performance Monitoring Team. The PMT’s are an integral part of NAVSEA’s PMP and assist SEA05U7 & PMS392 in:\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(1) Identifying and resolving fleet material issues. 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(2) Improving system reliability.\\n\\n(3) Reducing Total Ownership Cost (TOC).\\n\\n(4) Assessing system health across the fleet.\\n\\n(5) Improving the submarine fleet’s material condition and operational readiness. They do this by aiding in early identification of system deficiencies and predicting failures before they occur thereby avoiding more critical, mission-limiting failures.\\n\\n(6) Providing major shipyard availability inputs for work package definition.\\n\\n(7) Providing special inspection programs defined in reference (b), such as the Vibration Analysis Program.\\n\\n(8) Providing fleet maintenance assistance.\\n\\n 3-M Interface\\n\\nThe maintenance requirements and inspections that are monitored by PMT are fully integrated in the ship’s PMS system. PMP Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRCs) are coded with a \"K\" in the \"Other\" column on the MIP.\\n\\na. While the ship is responsible for scheduling this maintenance, the ship is supported by the PMT using an advanced engineering data collection and analysis information system. NAVSEA recommends that the ship frequently bring a copy of their Work Center PMS schedule with monitoring MRCs to the PMT to synchronize the ship to the PMT and vice versa.\\n\\nb. The performance of numerous cards calls for PMT assistance or PMT supplied test equipment which requires the ship to coordinate with the PMT concerning the accomplishment of this maintenance.\\n\\n PMT Documentation and Reporting\\n\\na. PMT CBM Deficiency Reports. The deficiencies and recommendations that result from a PMT inspection and monitored maintenance are published in an engineering memorandum called an On Site Analysis Report (OSAR). This material deficiency report is passed to the ship for corrective action and maintenance planning where applicable. In some cases, no repair action is required if a condition exists which is starting to degrade, yet does not meet repair standards. The OSAR is provided for information or other actions, such as increased monitoring frequency.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nThese OSARs are also uploaded to NAVSEA’s Submarine Maintenance Monitoring Information System (SMMIS) for advanced analysis and to aid in overall determination of system health.\\n\\nb. End of Monitoring Period (EMP) Reporting. Periodically, PMT will provide a report of the monitored maintenance as a summary closeout of the services provided and deficiencies noted. This report is provided to aid in the planning of the next monitoring period. Ship \"monitoring periods\" are conducted each calendar year and monitoring periods mirror the ship’s PMS schedule.\\n\\n Data Collected and Trended\\n\\nThe data collected per the Supplemental Report Forms (SRF) attached to the \"K\" MRCs, as well as the deficiency reports, is entered into the PMP Engineering Analysis System and uploaded in real-time to SMMIS. Over 10 years of data exists. The website provides the ability to retrieve the data and export to Excel spreadsheets as well as online graphing of data that behaves in a predictable fashion. Ship’s Force and other organizations may request historical data through the local PMT site.\\nb. End of Monitoring Period (EMP) Reporting.

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter describes and documents the development of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) based Common Assessment Procedures (CAP). As these documents reside on Maintenance Index Pages (MIP) in the Class Maintenance Plan (CMP) section as “AP” checks or requirements, they will for the purpose of this chapter be referred to as Assessment Procedures (AP).\\n\\n 2. Objective\\n\\nAPs are used to evaluate the material condition of Navy ships, systems, and equipment in support of Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM).\\n\\n 3. Scope\\n\\n- a. APs provide for standardized inspections used across carriers, surface ships, and other activities with similar systems and equipment. APs apply based on commonality. The two types of commonality invoked are:\\n1. (1) Functional use.\\n2. (2) Common platforms with similar systems and equipment.\\n- b. Submarines do not use APs. The submarine community has a Pre-Arrival Test (PAT) program with associated procedures that provides for similar functionality.\\n- c. These standards do not apply to, nor is development required for public or private shipyard new construction, modernization, or post-repair test procedures unless invoked by contract or specification.\\n\\n 4. Overview\\n\\n4-1\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\na. APs are applicable and effective maintenance measures. When properly and consistently executed, they deliver an accurate status and measurement of material condition, determine and document discrepancies, and specify repairs required to restore the material condition to a satisfactory state.\\n\\nb. Reference (a) institutes CBM as the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) strategy for maintaining ships, aircraft, and infrastructure material. CBM is designed to optimize life cycle maintenance program costs. CBM methodology dictates the performance of maintenance based on the objective evidence of need.\\n\\nc. RCM provides the maintenance engineering principles used to determine objective evidence of need. It also provides the methodology for determining and continuously improving applicable and effective maintenance requirements and associated maintenance assessment procedures.\\n\\nd. Under most circumstances APs can be used for inspection, certification and assist visit functions. This chapter establishes requirements for the development of APs in order to:\\n\\n- (1) Effectively evaluate material condition.\\n- (2) Ensure conformity to RCM standards.\\n- (3) Ensure procedures are useful for all of their intended purposes.\\n- (4) Support commonality of purpose and use.\\n- (5) Maximize commonality across ship classes to the extent system and equipment similarity allows.\\n\\n Policy\\n\\nDevelopment of APs must adhere to the technical standards listed in subparagraphs 5.a. and 5.b.\\n\\na.

AP Development. APs must be developed and periodically reviewed using RCM methodology.\\n\\n- (1) All new or modified maintenance requirements and procedures for use by government or contractor personnel aboard carriers, submarines, and surface ships must be developed or modified per reference (b). Use of the reference (b) process has been automated by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) eRCM application.\\n- (2) RCM analysis must be conducted and approved only by NAVSEA certified practitioners per Appendix I (RCM Certification Program) of this instruction. RCM analysis\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nResults and resultant assessment tasks and procedures must be reviewed and approved by the 17 Jun 2021 technical authority for the subject system or equipment, typically the In-Service Engineering Activity (ISEA) designated by the Technical Warrant Holder.\\n\\n(3) Results of RCM analysis and technically approved APs must be recorded by the Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Coordinating Activity, Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) per reference (b) for inclusion in the PMS database. Associated Intermediate or Depot-level tasks that call out the use of APs must be included in Class Maintenance Plans (CMP) by the applicable Program Executive Office (PEO) or NAVSEA CMP Coordinating Activity, Carrier Planning Activity (CPA), or Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP). The submarine community does not use APs.\\n\\nb. AP Format.\\n\\n(1) New or modified APs must be developed as Maintenance Requirements Cards (MRC) per reference (b). For equipment and systems for which an adequate assessment MRC has yet to be developed, the technical authority or the Technical Warrant Holder for the subject system or equipment may approve the use of other test formats. These formats can include but are not limited to technical manual procedures, System Operation and Verification Test (SOVT) procedures, shipyard test procedures or approved shipboard procedures. Shipboard procedures could include the use of Combat Systems Operational Sequencing System (CSOSS) or Engineering Operational Sequencing System (EOSS) procedures. In all cases, formats other than MRC procedures should be considered temporary. APs should be developed as MRCs to the maximum extent possible. MRCs are integral to the resourced 3-M Program of Record and are always available on the platform via Force Revisions. APs are used primarily by off-ship subject matter experts, but also may be used by Ship’s Force, with technical authority oversight, as a key element of distance support. APs must include all data fields required by reference (b) for MRCs. APs must clearly identify and explain all requirements needed to satisfy Inspection Points and Certification Statements. APs must be prepared using the NAVSEA New PMS Editor application.\\n\\n(2) Approved APs must be issued and managed per this instruction as part of the Navy’s Planned Maintenance System Management Information System (PMSMIS) database. CMP tasks may be used to call out the use of the APs. Discrepancies associated with and requests for modifications to APs or associated CMP tasks must be reported via the 3-M Feedback Report (FBR) System.\\n\\n(3) APs must be self-contained to the maximum extent practicable. The goal is to require minimum reference to other documents except for general references (e.g. NSTM 300 reference to electrical safety requirements) or to EOSS or CSOSS procedures.\\n\\n(4) Each AP must state qualification requirements and specify the skill, non-typical labor category, or both, required to perform the procedure. Examples include NAVSEA-designated\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nassessors and specific Ship’s Force ratings and ranks. Personnel with the qualifications listed on the AP possess the required skill and knowledge levels required to safely and efficiently execute the procedure.\\n\\n(5) APs must be thoroughly shipboard tested prior to implementation.\\nDiscrepancies associated with and requests for modifications to APs or associated CMP tasks must be reported via the 3-M Feedback Report (FBR) System.\\n\\n(3) APs must be self-contained to the maximum extent practicable.

Satisfactory completion of this testing must be recorded in PMSMIS along with RCM analysis documentation.\\n\\n(6) Procedural steps and situational triggers must be presented in language that is free of vague and ambiguous terms and uses simple words and phrases to convey the intended meaning. Appendices C and F of reference (c) provide writing and word choice guidelines.\\n\\n(7) Procedures must clearly define all failure modes and effects the procedure is designed to predict, identify, prevent or correct. Specific criteria must be provided to evaluate satisfactory and unsatisfactory conditions associated with these failure modes. In certain cases, such as extensive assessments of large or complex systems, it may be appropriate to define functional failures (e.g., low-level alarm fails to sound) vice functional failure (relay K-12 shorted to ground). In such cases, the generation of a Maintenance Action Form OPNAV 4790/2K noting completion of the task should lead to troubleshooting and repair actions.\\n\\n(8) Procedures must include failure threshold criteria values or parameters required to satisfy inspection or certification requirements. The implication of failure modes associated with being above or below threshold, including specific economic, safety or mission impacting concerns or operational limitations must be included in the procedure. Examples include:\\n\\n- (a) Increased cost to repair if rust is allowed to exceed some percent of exposed surface.\\n- (b) Significantly increased probability of line shaft bearing failure that would require decoupling of the shaft and subsequent reduction in top speed if bearing clearance is allowed to exceed some value.\\n- (c) Eventual deterioration of electrical insulation leading to risk of electrical shock and death if resistance value is allowed to decrease below a critical value.\\n- (d) Decertification of flight deck and restriction to \"emergency only\" flight deck operations if certain equipment is inoperable.\\n\\n(9) APs must explicitly address generation of a completion Maintenance Action Form OPNAV 4790/2K when required for recording of data for material condition history, inspection, or certification purposes or to document the need for corrective action.\\n\\n(10) APs must explicitly specify where and when measurements are to be taken, and how data is to be recorded. Appropriate qualitative or quantitative standards must be included to\\n\\n4-4\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\ndetermine satisfactory or unsatisfactory results, allowable tolerances or out-of-specification\\nranges, and adjustment set-points and tolerances as required. Required data may be qualitative\\n(e.g. record the visual appearance of the paint system) or quantitative (e.g. output temperature\\nrecorded in degrees Fahrenheit to the nearest half degree) as required based on results of RCM\\nanalysis or where required to support interval age exploration.\\n\\n(11) APs must explicitly address any specific criteria needed for documentation of \"as\\nfound material condition\" on completed Maintenance Action Form OPNAV 4790/2Ks when\\nrequired by the system, or equipment Life Cycle Manager, or Life Cycle Planning Activity.\\n(See paragraph 11.e of Appendix E)\\n\\n(12) Developed MRCs must clearly identify the need to document discrepancies found\\nduring planning for, or execution of, the procedure.

Introduction\\n\\n3-M SYSTEMS TRAINING\\n\\nThe Ships\\' Maintenance and Material Management (3-M) System consists of the Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and Maintenance Data System (MDS) and is the nucleus for managing maintenance aboard all ships and shore stations of the Navy. Personnel must have a clear understanding of:\\n\\n- a. How to effectively manage maintenance, configuration and logistics support appropriate to their position.\\n- b. How PMS is essential to sustaining material readiness.\\n- c. How and why managers at the systems commands are dependent upon the 3-M System for information to identify and correct Fleet material problems.\\n\\n2. Naval Education Training Command (NETC)\\n\\nNETC is responsible for maintaining a 3-M System training plan designed to meet the needs of the Fleet.\\n\\n3. TYPE Commanders (TYCOM)\\n\\nTYCOMs must ensure adequate 3-M Program training for all personnel within the command associated with maintenance, configuration and logistics support management. The TYCOMs are required to monitor and take corrective action to ensure ship compliance with 3-M policy and procedures, including a continuing quality review of 3-M data submitted by each ship. Shipboard on-the-job training represents the cornerstone of Fleet operational readiness and provides the optimum method of acquiring hands-on training. On-the-job training will be relied upon to sustain that level of knowledge and awareness received during formal training. Training should be continuous as new methods, procedures or features are introduced.\\n\\n4. 3-M Systems and 3-M System Support Ashore Training\\n\\nThe Center for Service Support (CSS) is the program manager for fleet-wide 3-M training.

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter provides an overview of the Class Maintenance Plan (CMP), its content, applicability and discusses the development and management process. Throughout this document, the term “ship” refers to all surface ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines.\\n\\n 2. Overview\\n\\na. Reference (a) requires each ship of a class to have a Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) approved CMP. The CMP contains detailed Organizational (O-Level), Intermediate (I-Level) and Depot (D-Level) maintenance requirements and notional maintenance cycles as tasked and funded by the Program Executive Offices (PEO).\\n\\nb. CMP requirements are developed using RCM methodology as described in reference (b) and executed following Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) methodology as defined in reference (c).\\n\\nc. Each CMP is developed to provide the information needed to plan, schedule and control I-level and D-level planned maintenance effectively. The cognizant life cycle maintenance planning activities -- Carrier Planning Activity (CPA), Submarine Maintenance Engineering for Planning and Procurement (SUBMEPP), and Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) -- manage requirements and scheduling of D-Level and I-Level maintenance requirements. The content and update of Organizational level (O-Level) and selected I-Level maintenance requirements (primarily Assessment Procedures (AP)) are managed by Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) for NAVSEA 04. Section 1, Chapter 2 of this instruction deals with the management of O-Level requirements.\\n\\nd. The CMP may also identify needed O-Level repair capabilities; I- and D-level specifications (e.g., number, type, duration, interval between, and man-day size of availabilities) and required support features such as facilities requirements, specific turnaround programs, insurance material programs, special diagnostic systems, and husbandry agents (e.g., Port Engineers).\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\ne. In addition to describing all preventive maintenance actions and maintenance support requirements, including material condition assessment requirements, approved modernization, and shipyard routines, the CMP may also include standard repairs required based on commonly expected assessment results.\\n\\n 3. Class Maintenance Plan\\n\\nThe CMP must encompass all essential maintenance elements required to economically sustain ship classes at a high state of material condition and reach their Expected Service Life (ESL). The three sections of a CMP are reviewed in subparagraphs 3.a through 3.c.\\n\\n a. Plan Overview\\n\\nThe plan overview section must provide a narrative description of the CMP, including major issues, solutions chosen and justification for the approaches taken in the CMP. This section describes the strategic plan and the role of maintenance in sustaining current and future readiness and material condition to ensure ships remain relevant and reach their expected service life. This includes outlining a detailed approach to managing a cost-effective maintenance program, linking requirements to resource needs, addressing high-cost maintenance drivers and system maturation. This section must also concentrate on maintenance and management processes for slow-to-degrade and distributed systems. Operational profiles as well as I- and D-Level maintenance periods are also addressed in relation to maintaining overall ship performance. The description must cover:\\n\\n- Design overview of the class to include capabilities, missions and design features used to achieve them.\\n- Unique characteristics of the class.\\n- Strategies required to maintain hull stability margins, environmental controls, power requirements, ventilation requirements, payload upgrades, etc.\\n- The delegated responsibilities of organizations tasked with administering and supporting the ship\\'s CMP (e.g., Regional Maintenance Centers, PEOs, CPA, SUBMEPP Activity, SURFMEPP Activity and husbandry agents such as Port Engineers or Maintenance Managers, etc.).\\n\\n b. Maintenance Requirements\\n\\nThe maintenance requirements section must list and describe all maintenance expected to be performed on ship systems and equipment so that maintenance and availability routine tasks can be effectively planned and executed. Certain I- and D-Level maintenance tasks reflected in the CMP are performed using APs (refer to Section II, Chapter 4).\\nOperational profiles as well as I- and D-Level maintenance periods are also addressed in relation to maintaining overall ship performance.

Maintenance Requirements\\n\\nThe maintenance requirements section must list and describe all maintenance expected to be performed on ship systems and equipment so that maintenance and availability routine tasks can be effectively planned and executed. Certain I- and D-Level maintenance tasks reflected in the CMP are performed using APs (refer to Section II, Chapter 4). APs are stored in the Planned Maintenance System (PMS) database in Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) format. There are two categories of CMP maintenance tasks, scheduled tasks, and unscheduled tasks.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(1) Scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks may include qualified repairs and life cycle renewal tasks; material condition assessment or inspection tasks; or approved ship changes (formerly called alterations) which have been deemed beneficial and cost effective when performed at fixed time intervals.\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(2) Unscheduled tasks. Unscheduled tasks are performed by a non-time-based event or by objective evidence of need. Unscheduled tasks are deemed beneficial and cost effective when performed as required or by an event trigger. Unscheduled tasks may include those listed in subparagraphs 3.b.(2)(a) through 3.b.(2)(c):\\n\\n- (a) Material Condition Assessment tasks available for troubleshooting or pinpointing degraded or failed components when unsatisfactory performance occurs or is suspected.\\n- (b) Corrective maintenance tasks where the scope of work is determined by obvious failure, observable degradation, or detected by either an on-line CBM diagnostic system or the accomplishment of a Material Condition Assessment task.\\n- (c) Concurrent maintenance tasks of a limited nature, which can be economically performed in conjunction with the accomplishment of a scheduled or other unscheduled task(s).\\n\\nc. Notional Class Maintenance Schedule. This section must summarize the projected I- and D-Level workload for each major availability in the notional operating cycle of a ship of the class from reference (d). This may require more than a single set of availability types in order to reflect such maintenance program differences as Continental United States (CONUS) home ported ships, forward deployed ships, and multi-crewed ships.\\n\\n Responsibilities\\n\\na. Commander, NAVSEA. As the lead systems commander for ship In-service support, NAVSEA must:\\n\\n- (1) Oversee the core processes for CMPs in acquisition programs and In-Service ships.\\n- (2) Support PEO Carriers, Team Ships (PEO Ships, SEA 21), PEO IWS, and Team Subs (PEO Subs and SEA 07) in the development and management of maintenance plans for each ship class, active and reserve, to ensure that U.S. Navy ships are cost effectively maintained in the highest possible state of material condition.\\n- (3) Ensure maintenance plans are continuously improved and updated as changes occur.\\n- (4) Establish Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) and Combat Systems technical requirements and provide the technical support necessary to safely maintain the material condition of all ships.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(5) Ensure all maintenance requirements are developed using RCM principles. 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(6) Establish policy for ensuring maintenance requirements are properly linked to ship configuration.\\n\\n(7) Ensure CMP changes are made by appropriately qualified and certified RCM practitioners.\\n\\n(8) Establish policy for and oversee execution of periodic RCM reviews of all CMP maintenance requirements.\\n\\n(9) Coordinate PEO CMP efforts to ensure the use of common, standard, best-practice maintenance requirements for like equipment across all ships.\\n\\n(10) Oversee and manage standardization of maintenance and modernization processes and products in support of the Navy\\'s drive toward \"one way of doing business\" for ship maintenance.\\n\\n(11) Review and approve CMPs, including those developed by PEOs, ensuring that they satisfy the requirements of reference (a), are technically correct, and are best suited to individual ship classes.\\n\\n(12) Ensure recommended changes to existing maintenance programs and CMPs are based on RCM experience and are cost effective.\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(6) Establish policy for ensuring maintenance requirements are properly linked to ship configuration.\\n\\n(7) Ensure CMP changes are made by appropriately qualified and certified RCM practitioners.\\n\\n(8) Establish policy for and oversee execution of periodic RCM reviews of all CMP maintenance requirements.\\n\\n(9) Coordinate PEO CMP efforts to ensure the use of common, standard, best-practice maintenance requirements for like equipment across all ships.\\n\\n(10) Oversee and manage standardization of maintenance and modernization processes and products in support of the Navy\\'s drive toward \"one way of doing business\" for ship maintenance.\\n\\n(11) Review and approve CMPs, including those developed by PEOs, ensuring that they satisfy the requirements of reference (a), are technically correct, and are best suited to individual ship classes.\\n\\n(12) Ensure recommended changes to existing maintenance programs and CMPs are based on RCM experience and are cost effective.\\n\\n b.

PurposeDATA ELEMENT DESCRIPTION AND VALIDATION SPECIFICATIONS\\nThis appendix identifies the data elements used for 3-M documentation and reporting, and provides a complete listing of the data elements and their descriptions. This appendix also includes the data element specifications used for 3-M reporting. Only the core 3-M data elements have been included, however, the use of additional data elements may be allowed if they support specific TYCOM, Program Manager, or OPNAV requirements.\\n\\n2. Objective\\nThe objective of this appendix is to ensure that 3-M data requirements are explicitly understood and followed. Divided into two sections, the validation specification portion followed by a data element description section. The validation specification portion can be used to:\\n\\n- a. Provide a means for organizational and intermediate level personnel to document information that is correct and complete.\\n- b. Establish data element requirements for all 3-M ADP systems, including systems that interface with 3-M.\\n- c. Provide a means for personnel conducting 3-M validations to ensure that 3-M data specifications are being followed.\\n- d. Establish requirements for reporting 3-M maintenance data.\\n\\n3. Data Element Specifications\\nFollowing the validation specification section is an alphabetical listing of the authorized 3-M data elements. This listing provides a short definition of each data element along with allowable codes and values where applicable. Updates to any of the Reference Codes may be requested according to Section III, Chapter 1, Reports and Services Available from Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC), paragraph 9.

The JCN is used to identify the maintenance action and to relate all of the parts used when a ship reports a maintenance action and it links all associated reporting of a maintenance action. The JCN is comprised of three blocks. Block 1 is the Ship’s/Activity’s UIC (5 numeric characters), Block 2 is the Work Center (WC) (see WC entry), and Block 3 is the Job Sequence Number (JSN) (see JSN entry). It is also the link for associating up-line reporting of a maintenance action when more than one activity is involved. It is important that all activities involved continue to use the same JCN on all maintenance and supply documents that apply to that particular maintenance action.|\\n|---|---|\\n|(2) Job Description/Remarks (CK)|Any remarks relating to the accomplishment of the maintenance action being reported. In some cases, the alteration directive will specify that certain information be documented.|\\n\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(3) Job Order Number (2K). The job order number assigned by the activity performing 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(4) Job Sequence Number (JSN) (2K, CK, 2P, and 2L). A 4-character number assigned by the Work Center to the maintenance action, or assigned by the outside activity performing the work. This is a number assigned sequentially from the Ship\\'s Work Candidate/JSN Log. The first position of the JSN is used to identify the tool or organization that created the 2K. In the case of activities other than the ship creating jobs for the ship, this first character will be an “Alpha” character. The Job Originator Table in the Maintenance and Modernization Business Unit (MMBU) available through the Naval Sea Logistics Center website under MMBU look up tables provides information on the “owner” of each “Alpha” character. The specific value contained within the first position of the JSN provides enhanced data mining capabilities and facilitates data aggregation and analysis. References to “National” values indicate that, based upon SHIPMAIN direction, an Information Technology application has been identified as the only authorized tool that will create 2Ks continuing the respective Job Originator Code.\\n\\n(5) Julian Date (2K, CK, 2P, and 2L). A 4-character entry composed of the last digit of the calendar year followed by the numerical day of the year (e.g., 1 January 1994 is \"4001\" and 31 December 1993 is \"3365\").\\n\\nk.

Both of these functions of maintenance and casualty reporting serve extremely beneficial purposes. They provide necessary information, not only in the realm of command and control of US Navy forces, but also in maintaining the unit in a truly combat ready status. Unit commanders will not delay or withhold reports in order to artificially maintain the unit’s readiness rating at a higher than actual level. Support from every level, including intermediate and group commanders, is essential in order to maintain the highest level of combat readiness throughout the Navy. Casualty reports will be made as required based on the command material condition. Priority for the work candidate will be set based upon the material condition and current situation of the command vice casualty reporting requirements. All priority changes or any updates to the work candidates will be documented in the block 35 recommended solution block of the work candidate. Every work candidate starts with a priority of four (4). To raise the priority, answer the questions and follow the steps of the priority flow chart Figure C-1.

Purpose MAINTENANCE PLANNING AND ESTIMATING To provide guidance in the completion and submittal of OPNAV Form 4790/2P, the Maintenance, Planning and Estimating form. This appendix previously included OPNAV 4790/2K (2-Kilo) and OPNAV 4790/CK (CK) preparation instructions. The information has been moved to the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM) Vol VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\n2. Background The 4790/2P (2-Papa) is used in conjunction with an OPNAV 4790/2K that defers maintenance to an Intermediate Maintenance Facility (IMF) for accomplishment. Attached to the original 2-Kilo at the IMA, it is used by the IMA to screen and plan the job in detail. The 2-Papa contains information pertinent to the Lead Work Center (LWC), assist Work Center(s), identifies material requirements, technical documentation, and provides estimated funding requirements to complete the maintenance action. (Upon approval by the TYCOM, planning, estimating and scheduling information may be entered in the appropriate sections of the OPNAV 4790/2K Form). NOTE: An example of a completed OPNAV 4790/2P form can be found at the end of this Appendix, Figure D-1.\\n\\n3. Procedures for Documenting Planning & Estimating Data\\n\\na.

Purpose\\nThis appendix describes pe Automated Periodic Maintenance Program (APMP) capabilities, provides guidelines for its use, and standardizes pe requirements in support of fleet and Depot 3-M reporting. This program was established to assist maintenance and material managers in pe execution of Class Maintenance Plan (CMP) and Life Cycle Manager (LCM) maintenance requirements to sustain weapon system operability.\\n\\n2. Scope\\nIntermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) require pe capability to generate work requests for periodic maintenance. Periodic Maintenance Requirements (PMR) provide pat capability. PMRs also provide pe capability to schedule, maintain, issue and report work accomplished for PMR items. PMR data elements conform to 3-M standards. PMRs require pe reporting of maintenance actions and configuration changes on all categories of equipment.\\n\\n3. Objective\\nThe APMP can provide a means to effectively manage and control all PMRs beyond pe scope of pe Planned Maintenance System (PMS). It is managed by integrating Systems Command (SYSCOM) Life Cycle Requirements, Configuration Data Managers\\' Database, Open Architecture (CDMD-OA) configuration data and periodicities invoked by system and equipment engineers wip pe 3-M Master Job Catalog (MJC) and PMR modules of intermediate maintenance management automated systems. This integration provides an automated pre-planned deferral to be added to pe Current Ship\\'s Maintenance Project (CSMP) and procurement of repair parts specified by technical repair standards or oper controlled work procedures. The system:\\na. Provides continuous evaluation and adjustment of pe CMP to reflect pe specifications of pe SYSCOM Platform Managers and pe capabilities and capacities of fleet maintenance activities.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\nSummary of tasks related to managing ship configuration and logistics support information systems, including database adjustments, MJC deferral development, UIC distribution, maintenance of databases, planning and execution of ship availabilities, work package management, reporting tasks progress, and distribution of maintenance data system information.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTasks Related to Ship Configuration and Logistics Support Information Systems Management,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Task: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\nSummary of tasks related to managing ship configuration and logistics support information systems, including database adjustments, MJC deferral development, UIC distribution, maintenance of databases, planning and execution of ship availabilities, work package management, reporting tasks progress, and distribution of maintenance data system information.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTasks Related to Ship Configuration and Logistics Support Information Systems Management,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Task: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\n|b.|Adjusts the Ship Configuration and Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) and the Configuration Data Manager (CDM) databases to reflect all levels of equipment and components for existing and emerging PMRs.|\\n|---|---|\\n|c.|Develops, evaluates and implements a MJC deferral for each PMR added to the CMP.|\\n|d.|Distributes a Unit Identification Code (UIC) unique configuration and scheduling record for each CMP periodic requirement to each activity maintaining the equipment/component.|\\n|e.|Maintains the MJC and PMR database at the central facility (regional hub, port facility, Regional Support Group (RSG) or Parent Squadron/IMA) supporting ship classes.|\\n|f.|Plans and executes ship scheduled availabilities and planned work packages by retrieval of all scheduled PMRs, alterations, Type Commander (TYCOM) directed and local support routines from the MJC/PMR module and all screened deficiencies from the tended ship\\'s CSMP into the Master CSMP of the central facility.|\\n|g.|Manages the execution of all authorized work, ensuring the progress, status change, delay and completion of each task is reported into 3-M as detailed in the applicable program user manuals.|\\n|h.|Produces and distributes PMR, CSMP and production information (Availability Summaries, Key Event Schedules and Progress, AWRs, Calibration Summaries, CSMP Summaries, etc.) as specified by TYCOM directives.|\\n|i.|Distributes Maintenance Data System (MDS) information from NAVSEALOGCEN (NSLC) to the applicable program managers and SYSCOM/fleet support activities for analysis and upgrade of:|\\n| |(1) CMPs,|\\n| |(2) Technical specifications,|\\n| |(3) Mandatory parts replacement requirements, (AWC),|\\n| |(4) Affirmation/adjustments of Lead Work Center (LWC)/Assistant Work Center|\\n| |(5) Task/key-op man-hour averages and|\\n| |(6) Standards for recycling MJC and PMR improvements.|\\n\\nE-2 Appendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n Manages the distribution of information between central activities and the organizational calibration and scheduling systems to support accomplishment of shipboard PMRs (e.g., Submarine Unrestricted Operations (URO) requirements and gage calibration by certified Field Calibration Activity (FCA) personnel.)\\n\\n Adds all Test and Monitoring System (TAMS) installed equipment records into the SCLSIS of the Class CDM so that cyclic requirements are tailored to the operating platform and the PMR scheduling record updated.\\n\\n Adds all portable TAMS to the SCLSIS for control by NAVWAR/NAVSEA Item Managers supported by Naval Weapons Assessment Division and Metrology Calibration (METCAL) organizations. This process:\\n\\n- Increases the management of portable TAMS inventory control between the METCAL CDM and the fleet\\'s central PMR configuration repository, CDMD-OA.\\n- Increases the management of alterations for portable TAMS applying business rules to justify upgrades. Controls TAMS alterations in the same manner as Ship Alterations (SHIPALTs) and TYCOM Alterations (ALTs). Provides information necessary to evaluate and improve reliability, maintainability, and availability of installed systems and equipment while eliminating periodic requirements where Material Condition Assessment (MCA) results indicate little risk of equipment failure.\\n\\n Master Job Catalog (MJC)\\n\\nThe MJC is a collection of recurring jobs applicable to multiple supported units. These jobs typically consist of PMRs from the CMP:\\n\\n- PMRs for inspection, test, calibration, and repair of various equipments;\\n- Alterations;\\n- Recurring Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) deficiencies;\\n- Routines for IMA services;\\n- Depot routines for interfacing the CSMP with the Ship Alteration and Repair Package (SARP)/Overhaul Work Package (OWP).\\n\\nThere are many advantages of using jobs from the MJC. Use of the MJC reduces the documentation burden for Ship\\'s Force in preparing deferrals for recurring maintenance actions. MJC preplanned jobs reduce the planning effort required by IMA Planning & Estimating (P&E).\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nPlanning information is usually recorded for the MJC jobs. In addition, it reduces the variability in job accomplishment. This contributes to the consistency of job requirements for each repetitive use of the MJC job. MJC jobs provide a ready vehicle for recording lessons learned as the job is accomplished time after time.\\n\\nc. The MJC is structured as a CSMP deferral and planning record. The MJC describes mandatory maintenance requirements, CMP periodic requirements, IMA support routines, alterations, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) procedures, calibration routines and other SYSCOM and TYCOM directed maintenance requirements applicable to one or more ship classes. The TYCOMs provide some MJC jobs, while individual IMAs prepare others. In addition, each central maintenance activity may establish additional service routines to account for production-oriented work not otherwise covered by TYCOM direction. These periodic or repetitive requirements are retrieved from the MJC and added to an individual ship\\'s Master CSMP for assignment to IMA and Depot Work Packages.\\n\\nd. Application of the MJC requirements prior to and during a ship\\'s availability relieves Ship\\'s Force from documenting other than its own discovered deficiencies. The onboard automated CSMP need contain only these deficiencies, while the MJC retrieved requirements (and the ship\\'s reported deficiencies) are maintained on a Master CSMP by the RSG, squadron or other central fleet activity.\\n\\ne. TYCOMs will establish joint instructions to identify common MJC requirements and standard procedures for its distribution and maintenance. The intermediate maintenance management automated systems user manuals describe methods to retrieve periodic requirements from the MJC for addition to the individual availability work package.\\n\\nf. A TYCOM designated planning activity (Submarine Maintenance, Engineering, Planning, and Procurement (SUBMEPP), Carrier Planning Activity (CPA) and / or Surface Maintenance, Engineering, Planning Program (SURFMEPP)) may be assigned to maintain and distribute MJC files to applicable fleet sites. These activities may also be tasked to provide analysis, improved planning and estimating, and material requirements for each documented MJC requirement.\\n\\ng. All periodic requirements established by the SYSCOMs for a ship class should include the repair parts required and the forecast to NAVSUP WSS Mechanicsburg to build an effective load list over the projected life cycle of the ship class. The planning activity should provide quarterly files to sustain the conjunctive Automated Material Requisitioning (AMR) for CMP projections.\\n\\nAppendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n5. 3-M Periodic Maintenance Requirements - 17 Jun 2021\\n\\nThere are certain equipment and components in the fleet that require periodic maintenance such as tests, inspections, repairs, restorations, and replacements.\\nThese activities may also be tasked to provide analysis, improved planning and estimating, and material requirements for each documented MJC requirement.\\n\\ng. All periodic requirements established by the SYSCOMs for a ship class should include the repair parts required and the forecast to NAVSUP WSS Mechanicsburg to build an effective load list over the projected life cycle of the ship class. The planning activity should provide quarterly files to sustain the conjunctive Automated Material Requisitioning (AMR) for CMP projections.\\n\\nAppendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n5. 3-M Periodic Maintenance Requirements - 17 Jun 2021\\n\\nThere are certain equipment and components in the fleet that require periodic maintenance such as tests, inspections, repairs, restorations, and replacements. For select automated systems, periodic maintenance tasks and routines are maintained on file with planning information. The record containing both the routine, test, etc., along with the scheduling and planning information is called a PMR.\\n\\na. Use of PMRs. Use of PMRs provide for the management of configuration and scheduling information for each equipment requiring periodic maintenance. As PMRs are established for equipment, Ship\\'s Force submits the related configuration and scheduling information. This information is used to establish a MJC routine. The MJC routine will be added to the CSMP when the equipment is due for periodic maintenance as indicated by the scheduling information. MJC routines can be scheduled for accomplishment by Ship\\'s Force or by an Intermediate or Depot-level activity.\\n\\nb. Configuration and Scheduling PMR Data. Both configuration and scheduling data files may be provided and downloaded from the CDM, planning activity, NSWC, METCAL, TAMS or from other SYSCOM or contractor sources supporting fleet maintenance. Ship\\'s Force may be required to initially document items for addition to the PMR database as directed by the TYCOM when the items require:\\n\\n- (1) Periodic testing.\\n- (2) Calibration.\\n- (3) Inspection by an intermediate level shop or fleet support team.\\n- (4) Electrical safety inspections.\\n- (5) Cyclic zone inspections by Damage Control teams vice sustaining a PMS Equipment Guide List (EGL) and requiring the ship to submit IMA work requests.\\n\\nDetailed operating procedures for MJC routines and PMRs are contained in Shipboard Non-Tactical ADP Program (SNAP) Central Design Activity (CDA) User Manuals and guides; these procedures are not repeated in this manual.\\n\\nc. PMR Reporting. PMR records and related equipment/component information can be maintained in the PMR/MJC system. Configuration file entries are made on-line. Standard 3-M data elements (Blocks 1 through 30 of the OPNAV 4790/CK) are used for PMR configuration reporting. For additional information/data element definitions and approved values refer to the data element by name in Appendix C of this instruction.

For example, NAVSEA Mechanical TAMS components use LCM code \"HM\" while electronic technicians TAMS uses \"ET.\" A ship\\'s PMR installation could use PMHM0001 and PMET0001 for up to 9999 components for each LCM. The total JCN for an initial \"ADD\" PMR item is then converted to reflect the PMR assigned Line Item Number (LIN) as part of the Work Center (WC/JSN) (e.g., PM001454 - where 001454 is the LIN) to become the permanent JCN for the life of the component on the UIC.\\n\\n Block A.

IMMP/URO submarine requirements.\\n\\ng. Tracking of multi-phase alterations.\\n\\nh. Corrosion control management. The decision to manage these cyclic requirements as single or multi-task requirements is usually determined by the scope of the task, and if a single Work Center can accomplish the task or whether multiple Work Centers will be required.\\n\\n 8. TAMS Calibration\\n\\nPMR provides the TAMS community with inventory management, calibration scheduling management and calibration results reporting capabilities. TAMS categorizes equipment requiring calibration and weight testing periodic maintenance. The MJC supports TAMS equipments and the special IMA Routines required to support calibration and weight test, periodic maintenance requirements that are to be accomplished during scheduled availabilities. The lab assigned responsibility for calibration and repair along with the Work Centers responsible for accomplishment are provided in the MJC.\\n\\n a. PMR tracks all due and overdue TAMS of each MJC category. For each periodic requirement that needs to be accomplished, PMR creates a single deferral for each scheduling record. This assists the Cal Labs in identifying all items requiring periodic test, monitoring/calibration to the customer ship and the IMA lab.\\n\\n b. When the items are delivered to the lab, PMR will track delivery, progression, status, completion and pick-up of each piece of test equipment. The Master CSMP will display within the single deferral all of the due/overdue items by line item, model, serial and nomenclature.\\n\\n c. As each task (TAMS item) is completed, the expended man-hours are accumulated against the production AWR and the detailed reporting of hours, delays, parts usage, out-of-tolerance readings and standards being used are recorded and up-line reported. This information is also retained in the PMR so that the Cal Labs have an on-line history of each ship\\'s TAMS.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nd. When the availability is completed, the Automated Work Request (AWR) is signed off for processing. A special record is automatically created for each item calibrated against the single CSMP JCN. Optionally, the AWR can be created each month or quarter and be closed at the end of the period.\\n\\ne. If any unscheduled TAMS items are delivered by the ship, the Lab (or TYCOM designated support activity) need only access the PMR record and add it to the outstanding AWR.\\n\\nf. The Cal Lab can call out a standard REPAIR routine for the specific lab and PMR item. For example, if Lab 67B cannot calibrate one of the 150 items provided, the unique MJC JCN with the item data from PMR is retrieved against the repairable item. This REPAIR routine assigns 67A (Electronics Repair) as the Assist Work Center and 67B inputs the defective item to 67A.\\n\\n Standard MJC Routines for TAMS Calibration and Weight Testing\\n\\nThe \"PMR WC\" entry of the MJC standard routines identify the specific Logistic Manager Code for each category of TAMS. ET = Electronics Technician, JR = NAVSEA RADIAC, etc. A \"2\" causes multiple task (line items) per single AWR, and the \"MC\" is the special suffix assigned to the Master CSMP deferral from the MJC. From the MJC routine record, a PMR WC entry adjacent to the REPAIR MJC will create one item per AWR. This item will have a unique WC suffix - \"CR\" for Cal Repair. This allows retrieval of all TAMS repair history from NSLC by keying on the JCN WC suffix or by MJC JCN which is contained in Block 18 of each MJC-originated CSMP deferral. The LCM code is included on each PMR detailed record reported to NSLC via 3-M.\\nThis table lists different types of MJC and PMR WC codes along with their corresponding values.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nMJC and PMR WC Codes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- LAB: None\\n- MJC FOR CAL: None\\n- PMR WC: None\\n- MJC FOR REPAIR: None\\n- PMR WC: None\\n\\nThis table lists different types of MJC and PMR WC codes along with their corresponding values.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nMJC and PMR WC Codes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- LAB: None\\n- MJC FOR CAL: None\\n- PMR WC: None\\n- MJC FOR REPAIR: None\\n- PMR WC: None\\n\\n|LAB|MJC FOR CAL|PMR WC|MJC FOR REPAIR|PMR WC.1|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|51C|N0000EXCAB702|HE2MC|N0000EXCAE702|HE CR|\\n|67B|N0000OXCAB701|ET2MC|N0000OXCAE701|ET CR|\\n|67F|N0000EXCAB703|JR2MC|N0000EXCAE703|JR CR|\\n|72D|N0000WXCNC719|HW2MC|N0000WXCNE719|HW CR|\\n|96A|N0000EXCAB704|HW2MC|N0000EXCAE704|HM CR|\\n|FCA|N0000EXCAB706|HM2MC|N0000EXCAE706|HM CR|\\n\\nE-17\\n\\nAppendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n10. Other Automated System in Support of PMR Other automated systems and system programs    17 Jun 2021\\ninterface with the MJC and PMR programs. Refer to TYCOM instructions and system user\\nmanuals for particular system capabilities and requirements.\\n\\n11. Using MJC JCN Structure to Manage Programs. The MJC File is created and managed the\\nsame as the CSMP file. Each \"deferral\" is a requirement or special work request (for service,\\nscheduling of alterations or specialized CMP requirements, etc.) which is copied to a CSMP or\\nwork package. The method by which many different programs can be added to a single MJC is\\nby control of the MJC JCN. In documenting an MJC, there are exceptions to the standard\\ndocumenting procedures for a CSMP deferral (OPNAV 4790/2K) as described in the Joint Fleet\\nMaintenance Manual, Volume VI, Chapter 19.\\n\\na. Fleet / TYCOM / Local Site MJC Control.\\n\\n(1) Block 1 UIC. The first character defines pe MJC Manager Code and identifies pe\\nactivity responsible for pe MJC item. It is assigned by pe TYCOM. This same code is used as\\na prefix to pe MJC JSN log. The following restrictions apply to pe use of MJC Manager Codes.\\nA       Not Used. Reserved for foreign ship UIC identity.\\nI       Not used to avoid confusion wip numeral 1.\\nO       Not used to avoid confusion wip numeral 0.\\nQ       Not used to avoid confusion wip numeral 0.\\nN       Used for MJC items issued and controlled by TYCOMs.\\nM       Used for MJC items issued and controlled by pe Fleet CINC.\\n\\nWhen MJC items are added to a ship\\'s CSMP, the program adds the original MJC JCN (with an\\n\"M\"-MJC-prefix) to the \"ALTERATION (Block 18)\" data field. This allows the 3-M history at\\nNSLC to be queried relative to man-hour and material cost expenditures. A single calibration\\nroutine can provide (by individual ship, RAUIC, type of ship, etc.) total cost per TYCOM for\\neach and all electronic calibration labs for specific periods of time. In addition, the associated\\nRepair routine will identify each unique piece of TAMS repaired during the same period. The\\nremaining four characters of the MJC UIC (BLOCK 1) identify MJC categories and the type of\\nships to which they apply. For each MJC UIC, there must be a corresponding UIC control\\nrecord added to the master file.\\n---\\nThis table lists various codes related to different types of ships and naval operations.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nNAVSEAINST 4790.8D Codes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Code: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\nThis table lists various codes related to different types of ships and naval operations.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nNAVSEAINST 4790.8D Codes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Code: None\\n- Description: None\\n\\n|NAVSEAINST 4790.8D|17 Jun 2021|\\n|---|---|\\n|0|All Ships|\\n|1|All Surface Ships|\\n|2|All SSNs|\\n|3|All SSBNs|\\n|6|SSN/SSBN|\\n|7|AEGIS CRUISERS|\\n|100|ALTS AS/AD|\\n|210|ALTS SSBN|\\n|230|ALTS SSN|\\n|4020|SSN OVERHAUL ROUTINES|\\n|5000|TRIDENT UNIQUE|\\n|5100|SEA WOLF UNIQUE|\\n\\n(2) Block 2 MJC WC Designations.\\n\\n(a) The left two letters identify the shipboard department and division to which the item normally applies.

Other combinations of the third and fourth letter may be used to identify other categories as directed by TYCOMs.\\n\\n(c) When the MJC item is an alteration controlled through a TYCOM alteration management system or the Fleet Modernization Program Management Information System (FMPMIS), the first letter will identify the shipboard department, the second letter will be \"X\" and the third and fourth letter will identify the type of alteration (SA, TY, etc.):\\n\\n1. The combination WC and JSN will be assigned by the alteration issuing authority and is displayed along with the structured alteration number on the alteration issuing directive.\\n2. The structured alteration number must be recorded in Block 18 of the MJC deferral exactly as described in Appendix H of this manual. This provides for an error-free Alteration Record being added to the ship\\'s CSMP and provides for the necessary 3-M to FMPMIS completion status feedback. Because Block 18 is prefilled, the MJC JCN will not be copied into that field in the CSMP. However, the Alteration Management System (AMS) WC/JSN will be assigned as the ship\\'s WC/JSN. This same combination must be reported on the completed OPNAV 4790/CK Configuration Change Record rather than a shipboard assigned WC/JSN.\\n3. An additional restrictive WC/JSN combination is for tracking the standard Depot Overhaul Routines which have an MJC WC of \"EXSY\" and are identified in the OWP so that Depot estimates and return costs can be reported to the SWLIN/ESWBS level and individual Work Center deferrals from the CSMP can be grouped and costs accounted for under the EXSY \"bucket jobs.\" These standard EXSY routines retain the MJC WC/JSN when added to the CSMP and allow the Ship\\'s Engineer and Overhaul Coordinator to track the overhaul progress by use of the CSMP. NAVSEA (SEA 07) directed these procedures be followed by SUPSHIP and Shipyards when costing Departure Reports and to provide for Depot 3-M reporting.\\n\\n(3) Block 3 MJC JSN Prefix for Work Category. This entry is the sequence number of the item unique to the MJC \"Work Center\" code. It is usually all numeric, but there may be conjunctive or associated actions following an MJC inspection, test, or calibration. If so, the total set should reflect a different alphabetic code as the first character of the JSN.\\n\\nb. Documenting the MJC Deferral. The amount of detail within an individual MJC item is dependent on whether the action required is to provide IMA routines such as \"Printing Services\", specific non-scheduled refurbishment or repair for a recurring failure of a specific APL, standard procedure for docking/undocking ships, corrosion control inspections of piping, or PMR scheduling of individual components. Details will be provided by TYCOM directives.\\n\\nAppendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nc. Evaluating Requirement for Single or Multi-Task. 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(1) When the MJC item is being created for general service routines, and is not to interface with PMR configuration and scheduling, follow the standard deferral documentation procedures and describe in the Remarks data field (Block 35 of the 2K) the actions required for the routine. An example entry may read, \"IMA provide sheet metal service. Limit to 1/8\" thick metal. S/F provide sketch on OPNAV 2L. Maximum 100 man-hours.\"\\n\\n(2) When the MJC item is written to interface with the PMR, the details of the equipment or component is a function of the PMR configuration and scheduling records. When a single requirement requires a single JCN, data element fields for \"Alterations\" (Block 4), \"Component Noun Name\" (Block 13), and \"Component Identification\" (Block 16) of the MJC will contain an asterisk. The data will be pre-filled from PMR when retrieved into the CSMP. An individual work request (JCN) per component is appropriate when multiple Work Centers are to be involved in the requirement or when there is a requirement for Controlled Work Procedures required by TYCOM Quality Assurance Procedures. For example:\\n\\n(a) If there were 100 sea valves due for a 72-month refurbishment, 100 separate JCNs would be added to the CSMP.\\n\\n(b) If there were a second requirement to visually check all sea valves for external corrosion every 24 months, an additional MJC item would be created and another PMR scheduling record would be added to each sea valve configuration record.\\nWhen a single requirement requires a single JCN, data element fields for \"Alterations\" (Block 4), \"Component Noun Name\" (Block 13), and \"Component Identification\" (Block 16) of the MJC will contain an asterisk. The data will be pre-filled from PMR when retrieved into the CSMP. An individual work request (JCN) per component is appropriate when multiple Work Centers are to be involved in the requirement or when there is a requirement for Controlled Work Procedures required by TYCOM Quality Assurance Procedures. For example:\\n\\n(a) If there were 100 sea valves due for a 72-month refurbishment, 100 separate JCNs would be added to the CSMP.\\n\\n(b) If there were a second requirement to visually check all sea valves for external corrosion every 24 months, an additional MJC item would be created and another PMR scheduling record would be added to each sea valve configuration record. In this situation, the MJC would be coded as multi-tasked and one JCN would be created with 100 tasks (1 task per valve). MJC calibration routines are all coded as multi-tasked.\\n\\nd. Standard Narrative (Block 35). Narrative should include a statement of the requirement and include notices to the tended unit and LWC on ship-to-shop or special controls. The deferral narrative is limited to 1200 characters. However, when the AWR is completed, an additional 1200 characters may be used by the LWC to provide feedback information (free-form) to the SYSCOM directing the requirement.\\n\\ne. Structured Narrative (Block 35). There are two types of structured narrative provided by the MJC: (1) Certain inspection or test criteria are specified by the requirement in which the LWC/AWC is to feedback the material condition assessment by \"yes/no\" responses to conditional questions printed on the CSMP AWR. In these cases, the narrative will begin with a general statement of the requirement, followed by specific inspection conditions and a response space for \"Y\" or \"N.\" For example: \"Was there evidence of external leakage? (); corrosion? ().\" E-21 Appendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(2) Certain equipment is designated for specialized reporting by the LCM or item manager and the organization. Automated ships\\' systems must flag the SEF to display the structured narrative specified and funded by the LCM. This requires the shipboard technician to enter \"as found\" readings and symptoms which are up-line reported for SYSCOM analysis. If an extension of these specialized reporting requirements to the off-ship IMA technicians is required, the PMR screen could display a similar format (refer to Appendix C, data element \"REMARKS/DESCRIPTION\" for Selected Equipment List (SEL) reporting requirements).\\n\\nf. Documenting the MJC P&E. The OPNAV 4790/2P is used for MJC P&E with entries made as described in Appendix D except for the following:\\n\\n1. Section I – Planning.\\n- Block A - SHIP\\'S NAME. Enter the \"MJC ITEM.\"\\n- Block B - HULL NUMBER. Leave Blank.\\n- Blocks 1-3 - JOB CONTROL NUMBER. Enter the same JCN as assigned to the attached MJC 2K.\\n- Block 4 - PERIODIC MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT NUMBER. If the MJC is for a PMR, enter the appropriate number from the CMP or other directive.\\n- Block 5 - PERIODICITY. If applicable, enter the periodicity of the requirement established.\\n- Block 6 - YEAR AND MONTH ISSUED. Enter the date (YYMM) the PMR was issued.\\n- Block 7 - SPECIAL DATA. The first two positions are to identify the LCM code controlling the PMR. These codes are:\\n- ET – NAVWAR Electrical/Mechanical TAMS\\n- HE – NAVSEA Electrical TAMS\\n- HM – NAVSEA Mechanical TAMS\\n- HP – NAVSEA SUBMEPP/GEN Scheduling\\n- HS – NAVSEA Electrical Safety\\n\\nAppendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n6.

Leave blank if the MJC is for non-PMR service routines. The fourth and fifth position are provided to record a special program WC suffix to the output CSMP JCN (e.g., Submarine IMMP/URO/LID/SEOC programs are assigned \"JC\" as a suffix). If no entry is made, the output JCN will be assigned a WC suffix of \"MC.\"\\nHW – NAVSEA Weight Handling Equipment 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n7. JR – NAVSEA Radiac TAMS\\n\\nThe third position is for entering whether the MJC is to control single or multi-component JCNs. Leave blank if the MJC is for non-PMR service routines. The fourth and fifth position are provided to record a special program WC suffix to the output CSMP JCN (e.g., Submarine IMMP/URO/LID/SEOC programs are assigned \"JC\" as a suffix). If no entry is made, the output JCN will be assigned a WC suffix of \"MC.\" Only alpha codes should be assigned to separate MJC retrieved deferrals from shipboard created deficiency deferrals.\\n\\n(h) Block 8 - SCREENING ACTION. When authorized by TYCOM instructions, the MJC may be designated as preapproved. Entry of the screening code will cause the MJC retrieval to bypass normal screening action and the JCN will be sent directly for release to the IMA for accomplishment.\\n\\n(i) Block 9 - QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (QA). Assign the QA requirements applicable to the MJC. The PMR scheduling record for individual components will take precedence during call-down.\\n\\n(2) Section II – Scheduling.\\n\\n(a) Block 12 - LEAD WORK CENTER (LWC). Enter the code of the LWC assigned to control the coordination and completion of the total JCN. When the MJC is for multi-component inspection/calibration/testing, the primary WC is assigned. When an associated \"Repair\" MJC is to be created, assign the same primary WC as LWC and other required WCS as assisting (AWC). To ensure standardization for IMA capabilities and continuity when transferring work packages, the TYCOM controlled MJC assigned LWC must not be changed unless approved by TYCOM direction.\\n\\n(b) Blocks 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, and 43. As required.\\n\\n(c) SCHED START DATE. Enter a numeric value for the start day relative to the start of the availability. When the MJC is subsequently retrieved and added to the CSMP, the relative day will be added to the availability start date and outputted as a Julian date on which each task is to be started by the LWC and any AWCs. Note that multi-component MJCs will not include AWC entries.\\n\\n12. Establish Bill of Materials Interface. When the MJC is for refurbishment of APL identified components, the repair part requirements (both mandatory and conditional) are provided on electronic media by the LCM or TYCOM assigned planning activity (SUBMEPP/SURFMEPP/CPA). When the MJC is retrieved for each component, an automated material requisition is produced for mandatory parts and a list of contingency items provided\\n\\nE-23 Appendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nwith the work request. The same format record can be added by local sites if local MJC items are developed.\\n\\n13. MJC Alteration Documentation Differences. Alterations added to the MJC will be limited to those managed by the AMS. These are identified by the assignment of the AMS WC/JSN and structured alteration number as described in the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM).\\n\\n- Block 1 - UIC. Enter the MJC UIC established by the TYCOM.\\n- Blocks 2-3 - WC AND JSN. Enter the WC/JSN assigned by the alteration issuing authority.\\n- Block 18 – ALTERATIONS.

Block 27 – MHRS REM. Entry must be numeric. The use of “AUTO” (auto-close) is not appropriate for MJC alterations. Completion of deferrals for alterations must be by OPNAV 4790/CK.\\n\\n14. MJC Index and Statistics. The MJC Index (Figure E-1) is produced as required by TYCOM instructions. A number of selection parameters are provided during call-down to limit the volume of the Index to particular applications. MJC JCNs required by tended ships may be recorded on the OPNAV 4790/2L and provided to the TYCOM-designated support activity during the availability arrival conference. Selected MJC JCNs may be called down as directed by the TYCOM prior to the availability or by quarter year (e.g., calibration routines) and may be assigned to other than the scheduled availability. This allows the Production Management Assistant (PMA) and other managers to focus on correction of deficiencies with weekly status reports of Service Routines progression. Also available is the MJC Call-Down Frequency Report. A number of selection parameters are provided to limit the volume of the report to particular applications. Available is a report on the number of times the MJC JCN was retrieved and the last retrieval date. This report allows monitoring of mandated JCN call-downs and also provides for culling out of locally created MJC routines which are seldom used. (Refer to the applicable system’s user manual for additional reports that may be generated.)\\n\\nE-25 Appendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n15. Analysis of MJC/PMR Originated Production History. Each JCN called down from the MJC as a deferral into the Master CSMP is assigned a CSMP JCN different than the MJC JCN. Each specialized project may be assigned a unique WC suffix so that the Program Manager may retrieve selective history from the NSLC 3-M database on the MJC Call-Down Frequency Report (Figure E-2).\\n\\na. Some special program WC suffix codes currently being used are:\\nThis table provides information on various routines and jobs related to depot-level availability, repair of components, and scheduled maintenance tasks.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nSHIPALTS,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- XSA: None\\n- XTY: None\\n- EXSY: None\\n- XCR: None\\n- JC: None\\n\\nThis table provides information on various routines and jobs related to depot-level availability, repair of components, and scheduled maintenance tasks.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nSHIPALTS,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- XSA: None\\n- XTY: None\\n- EXSY: None\\n- XCR: None\\n- JC: None\\n\\n|_XSA|SHIPALTS|\\n|---|---|\\n|_XTY|TYCOM ALTS|\\n|EXSY|Depot-level (SY=Shipyard) availability routines.

Each failed component will be assigned a unique JCN.|\\n|_JC|IMMP/RO/LID and other scheduled CMP PMRs.|\\n\\nb. When a special program code is not assigned, the program will assign a WC suffix of \"MC.\" If allowed by TYCOM instructions, the ship may assign its own WC/JSN to the MJC routine. With the exception of MJC Alterations, each retrieved MJC deferral will have its MJC JCN prefixed with an \"M\" and be written to the Configuration/Alteration Number field (block 18) of the CSMP deferral.\\n\\nc. When the MJC is designated as multi-level, the MJC call-down is linked to the PMR scheduling file and retrieves all due and overdue components as tasks within the one CSMP deferral JCN. This will result in a family of data records being created to capture the METCAL required data when the lab reports completion of each component.\\n\\nd. Each Program Manager is able to retrieve and analyze all transactions unique to the MJC JCN and WC suffix code assigned to a special program.\\n---\\nNAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n16. Modification of On-Site MJC. Implementation, distribution and maintenance of the MJC 17 Jun 2021 will be as described in this instruction and supplemented by Fleet/TYCOM instructions. It is essential that existing MJC files, which have common application, be adapted by those commands not yet implemented. This will speed-up integration of the Regional Maintenance Hubs and provide continuity to the existing 3-M database for Program Manager requirements.\\n\\na. The Fleet Maintenance Management System will provide connectivity to the SYSCOMs for data storage and distribution.\\n\\nb. The FLTCINCs/TYCOMs will provide instructions for management of the MJC to include centralized and on-site control.\\n\\nc. The existing method of confirming updates to the MJC by the IMAs is by including a \"completed AWR record\" in the update files sent from the originator. The originator subsequently monitors the MDS data.\\n\\nE-27 Appendix E\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nThis table provides information about the sequencing activity related to the USS Emory S.

Purpose\\n\\nThis Appendix describes how approved alterations are incorporated into the 3-M System. It is intended as a guide for understanding the process and to assist in annotating the required Maintenance Data System (MDS) records and documents required to plan, and execute modernization to a vessel, its systems, and/or equipment.\\n\\n2. Discussion\\n\\nNavy Modernization has progress from the Fleet Modernization Program (FMP), to the Ship Maintenance (SHIPMAIN) process to the Navy Modernization Program (NMP) of today. Under the old FMP program there were 13 modernization alteration types; under NMP there are only two modernization types (Fleet and Program). The FMP manual was retired in 2009 and replaced with the NMP-MOM. There are still multiple types of alterations under each category depending on the planned Scope, Category, Duration and Funding identified during the modernization creation. The modernization items are created in the Navy Data Environment - Navy Modernization (NDE-NM) database once approved.\\n\\na. The NMP - Management and Operations Manual (MOM) (NMP-MOM) provides the governance, approval and execution processes necessary to ensure the NDE applications meet stakeholder requirements to manage alterations for individual hulls based on scheduled ship availabilities. NMP outputs:\\n\\n- When a Ship Change Document (SCD) is approved at any phase, it becomes part of the MODPLAN, which provides a summary of approved modernization affecting designated Surface Ships and Aircraft Carriers. The approved SCD is also scheduled to specific ships in the NDE-NM module, which in turn serves as the authoritative database of planned modernizations for each ship.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(2) The ship-specific list of scheduled modernization in NDE-NM forms the basis of the Hull Modernization Plan (HMP) for that ship. HMP products are used to develop the Maintenance and Modernization Business Plan (MMBP) for surface ships or the Availability Work Package (AWP) for Aircraft Carriers. SCDs that are included in the HMP for a specific Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) or Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) (Aircraft Carriers only) availability are included on the Letter of Authorization (LOA) (or equivalent) specific to that availability.\\n\\n(3) Surface Ship availability planning activities are informed of planned modernization work through the HMP and LOA processes. There are several HMP products prepared for surface ship availability planning. The Advance Planning HMP (AHMP) is prepared by the cognizant SPM in July of each year and provided to Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC) to facilitate advance planning for ships under their cognizance. The Execution Planning HMP (EHMP) is provided by the cognizant SPM in March of each year to the RMCs to support development of each ship’s MMBP. SPM and Type Commander (TYCOM) LOAs (or equivalent) provide definitive installation authority for each CNO availability.\\n\\nNOTE: For LCS Variants, modernization data for all ships covering the timeframe of the AHMP and EHMP is maintained in one document called the LCS Hull Modernization Plan (LHMP) and provided monthly to the RMCs. LOA, AHMP and EHMP data can be extracted from the LHMP at any time.\\n\\n Objective\\n\\nThe NMP provides a disciplined process to deliver operational and technical modifications to the U.S. Naval Fleet in the most effective and cost efficient way. The process defines a standard methodology to plan, budget, engineer, and install timely, effective, and affordable shipboard improvements while maintaining Configuration Management (CM) and supportability. The objective of the NMP is to assure that fleet modernization investments address the fleet’s greatest concerns and are integrated and prioritized across Strike Groups, Ships, Systems and Warfare area. The process directly involves Navy leadership at all levels (Fleet, Office of the CNO (OPNAV), Force TYCOMs, Systems Commands (SYSCOMs) and Program Executive Offices (PEOs)) in the programming, planning and installation of modernization in a consistent and disciplined manner.\\n\\n Definitions\\n\\na.\\nAlteration Identifier.\\nIdentifies the alteration by incorporating all of the mandatory key fields by Alteration Type. This data field is a composite of various data fields; that are known as ‘Key Fields’.\\nAppendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nThe table provides information on different alternative types and their corresponding details, such as numbers, revisions, changes, and system affected.

Modernization. Modernization consists of all efforts and costs that lead to changes of an In-Service Surface Ship or Carrier. These changes include upgrades or replacement of existing systems by new systems satisfying new requirements. All product development, procurement and installation costs are included as well as costs that are not specific to particular alterations, but are required to execute the Modernization Program. Product development costs are generally paid for within RDTEN 6.3 and 6.4 funding. Procurement and installation costs may be paid for with OPN, WPN, APN, SCN or O&MN funds. The domain includes RDTEN and procurement required for developing and upgrading systems. Any nuclear propulsion changes will be excluded from the Ship Maintenance (SHIPMAIN) process.\\n\\nc. Ship Change Document (SCD). The change input vehicle for the single authoritative web-enabled database, NDE-NM. A SCD is defined as any new idea, spanning the complexity of a new 21st century Gun Weapons System to the replacement of a manually operated valve with a more reliable alternative. All SCDs will address the need for safety of personnel and equipment and/or provide increased reliability, maintainability and efficiency of installed equipment. There are two types of SCDs:\\n\\n- (1) Fleet Changes. Fleet SCDs are programmed for installation by the Fleet (TYCOM), as well as funded for accomplishment by the Fleet or other organizations as agreed upon.\\n- (2) Program Changes. Program SCDs are programmed for installation by SYSCOMs or PEOs, as well as funded for accomplishment by the SYSCOMs, PEOs or other organizations as agreed upon.\\n\\nd. Industrial Activity. Any activity that has the capability to perform all aspects of work on ships. These activities generally include Naval Bases, Naval Ship Repair Facilities (NSRFs), Intermediate Maintenance Facilities, Trident Refit Facilities (TRFs), public (Naval) shipyards and private shipyards that hold Agreements for Boat Repair (ABR) or Master Ship Repair (MSR) Agreements per the NAVSEA Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair (SUPSHIP) USN Operations Manual.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n5. Alteration Types 17 Jun 2021\\n\\na. Alteration-Equivalent-To-Repair (AER). An Alteration-Equivalent-To-Repair (formerly known as a Letter AER for Surface Ships, an Alteration and Improvement (A&I) for Submarines, and an Alteration Request for Aircraft Carriers) is a permanent alteration formally approved by the SPM, typically via letter, which has one or more of the attributes described in TYCOM Alterations (see paragraph 4.d.).\\n\\n- (1) AERs must satisfy all of the following criteria:\\n\\n- (a) It does not impact Battle Force Interoperability (BFI).\\n- (b) It does not impact the ship’s stability records (weight and moment) replacing.\\n- (c) It does not impact or alter the 3-dimensional footprint of the equipment it is\\n- (d) It does not impact shipboard distributive systems (i.e., water, ventilation, electrical, power), the Ship’s Selected Record (SSR) or interfacing equipment or systems; compartmental arrangement records; or Damage Control records.\\n- (e) It does not impact Manpower and Personnel.\\n\\n- (2) All AERs require the SPM to obtain approval from the technical authority. Non-military improvements may be approved and authorized for accomplishment by the cognizant SPM.\\n- (3) The following procedures will be followed if the SPM’s internal review determines that the proposed AER should be accomplished as a Ship Alteration (SHIPALT) (Title “F”, “D”, “KP”, or “K”) or is already under development as a SHIPALT:\\n\\n- (a) An AER can be a prerequisite to a SHIPALT such as Title “F” and “D” SHIPALTs. In this case, information relating to the development of the SHIPALT will be included in the body of the AER recommendation letter. Additionally, it should be stated that affected Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products will be covered during the SHIPALT development and execution.\\n- (b) AERs can be accomplished in place of SHIPALTs where an emergent requirement of limited applicability dictates. In this case, the body of the recommendation letter must state that the Planning Yard (PY) must prepare the AER installation procedures.\\n\\nH-4 Appendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(c) If a proposed AER is required until the accomplishment of a SHIPALT, the AER recommendation will identify the SHIPALT and its estimated completion date.\\nIn this case, information relating to the development of the SHIPALT will be included in the body of the AER recommendation letter. Additionally, it should be stated that affected Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products will be covered during the SHIPALT development and execution.\\n- (b) AERs can be accomplished in place of SHIPALTs where an emergent requirement of limited applicability dictates. In this case, the body of the recommendation letter must state that the Planning Yard (PY) must prepare the AER installation procedures.\\n\\nH-4 Appendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(c) If a proposed AER is required until the accomplishment of a SHIPALT, the AER recommendation will identify the SHIPALT and its estimated completion date. All detailed procedures, material requirements and ILS requirements will be excluded from the letter.\\n\\n- Authorization. Empowers a command to direct a specified alteration to be accomplished.\\n- Approval. An action of the cognizant SPM signifying the accomplishment of an alteration is technically feasible. Evidence of \"Approval\" is the signature of the SPM on the Ship Alteration Record (SAR), AER or Temporary Alteration (TEMPALT).\\n\\nb. Equipment Alteration. Any alteration, other than a SHIPALT, in the configuration of an equipment or system (including embedded equipment, computer programs and expendable ordnance) after establishment of the product baseline.\\n\\n- An Equipment Alteration involves a change in design, type of material, quantity, installed location, logistics, supportability, or the relationship of the component parts of an assembly within the ship.\\n- Equipment Alterations include the addition, deletion, rework, or replacement of parts, assemblies or equipment; or changes in assembly procedures.\\n- Alterations to associated computer programs include the incorporation of different computer program versions and approved modification or corrections to both operational test and maintenance programs.\\n- Equipment Alterations are initiated by approved Class I Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).\\n- Equipment Alterations apply equally to changes installed in delivered systems and equipment, and changes installed in systems and equipment in production to identify differences from an established product baseline.\\n- Equipment Alterations may be initiated to correct a design defect, to change equipment operational capability, to eliminate safety hazards, to update obsolete components, or for any combination of these reasons.\\n- There are four types of Equipment Alteration (Engineering Change (EC), Field Change (FC), Machinery Alteration (MACHALT) and Ordnance Alteration (ORDALT)) that are defined below:\\n\\nEngineering Change (EC)\\nA modification, usually to Under-Sea Warfare (USW) equipment or systems, or other equipment groups as designated by the cognizant Systems\\n\\n Appendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nCommand, Program Manager (PM), Participating Acquisition Resource Manager (PARM), and 17 Jun 2021 Configuration Control Boards (CCBs).\\n\\n(b) Field Change (FC). A mechanical, electronic or electrical change, modification or alteration made to electronic equipment after delivery to the government or installation on board ship, including software changes, which do not impact interfaces to other equipment within the ship, change the footprint, form or fit, change power, weight, or air conditioning requirements. If power, weight or air conditioning requirements are modified, the modification must be discussed with the appropriate SPM, who will decide whether to proceed with the modification as a FC or SHIPALT. FCs are initiated and approved by the cognizant Headquarters Systems Command and are implemented by Field Change Bulletin (FCB). Alteration Installation Teams (AITs) or Ship’s Force can accomplish FCs. For these specific types of alterations, the cognizant SPM must be notified of the approved changes affecting their respective platforms, must be periodically advised of installation status and must be notified of any logistics upgrades, which have been completed as a result of the alteration.\\n\\n(c) Machinery Alteration (MACHALT). A planned change, modification or alteration of any Hull, Mechanical or Electrical (HM&E) equipment in service (shipboard or shore activities) when it has been determined by the MACHALT CCB that the alteration or modification meets all of the following conditions:\\n\\n- Can be accomplished without changing an interface external to the equipment\\n- Are modifications made within the equipment boundary or is a direct replacement of the original equipment system.\\n- Can be accomplished without the ship being in an industrial activity.\\n- Can be accomplished individually, not conjunctively with a SHIPALT or other MACHALT.

Ship Alteration (SHIPALT). SHIPALTs are classified by title/type and comprise any change in hull, machinery, equipment, or fittings that involves changes in design, material, quantity, location, or relationship of the component parts of an assembly.\\n\\nAppendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nNOTE: Other alterations which modify shipboard systems such as ordnance alterations, electronic field changes, air alterations, and special project alterations are not considered SHIPALTs, but may require conjunctive SHIPALTs where systems interface changes are involved.\\n\\n(1) SHIPALT Title. The title assigned to a SHIPALT identifying the approving authority and responsibility for funding. SHIPALT titles are:\\n\\n(a) Title “D”. A permanent alteration pat does not affect pe military characteristics of a ship. It is formally approved by pe SPM in pe form of a Justification/Cost Form (JCF) and a SAR. It may require Centrally Provided Material (CPM) but does not require Headquarters CPM (HCPM). A Title “D” SHIPALT may specify wheper it should be accomplished only by a depot-level maintenance facility. They generally include more efficient, cost effective designs pat improve ship maintainability, and meets one or more of pe TYCOM Alteration attributes described in paragraph 4.d, TYCOM Alterations.\\n(b) Title “F”. A permanent alteration pat is formally approved by pe SPM in pe form of a JCF and a SAR. It does not require Centrally Provided Material (CPM) or Headquarters CPM and is wipin pe Ship’s Force capabilities for accomplishment; however, it may be accomplished by a Fleet Maintenance Activity (FMA). It must also meet one or more of pe TYCOM Alteration attributes described in paragraph 4.d, TYCOM Alterations.\\n(c) Title “K”. A permanent alteration to provide a military characteristic an upgrade to existing systems or provide additional capability not previously held by a ship. This may affect configuration controlled areas or systems of a ship which operwise require pe installation of Headquarters Centrally Provided Material (HCPM). These SHIPALTs are approved for development and auporized for accomplishment by pe CNO (military improvements) or pe Hardware Systems Command (HSC) (non-military improvements). The technical approval for Title “K” SHIPALTs is provided by NAVSEA.\\n(d) Title “K-P”. A Title “K” SHIPALT is wipin forces afloat or AIT capability for accomplishment, and requires pe cognizant HSC to provide packaged special program and centrally provided materials.\\n(e) Non-Permanent Changes (NPC). Previously referred to as Temporary Alteration (TEMPALT) and have a designation of TMP for pe Alteration Type. An NPC is defined as a change pat will be installed for Test & Evaluation (T&E) purposes to demonstrate or aid in pe demonstration of a new or improved capability for pe Fleet. While typically fielded on a single ship, an NPC may be fielded on multiple ships if required to meet T&E objectives. Additionally, NPCs can be used to provide an interim capability to support operational and training requirements for Platform TYCOMs, Commander, Naval Information Force (COMNAVIFOR), Operational Commanders, Immediate Superior In Command (ISIC), or Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) when formal justification and approval is provided.\\n\\nAppendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nd. TYCOM Alterations.\\n(e) Non-Permanent Changes (NPC). Previously referred to as Temporary Alteration (TEMPALT) and have a designation of TMP for pe Alteration Type. An NPC is defined as a change pat will be installed for Test & Evaluation (T&E) purposes to demonstrate or aid in pe demonstration of a new or improved capability for pe Fleet.

TYCOM Alterations. TYCOM Alterations are approved by the SPM for accomplishment as a Title “D” or “F” SHIPALT or AER depending upon the scope and effects of the change after review by the appropriate technical authority (e.g. TWH, Engineering Agent etc.). TYCOM Alterations are programmed for installation by the TYCOM, as well as funded for accomplishment by the TYCOM or other organization as agreed upon. TYCOM Alterations are maintenance alterations normally accomplished to improve reliability or maintainability. A TYCOM Alteration is a technical alteration that has one or more of the following attributes:\\n\\n- The use of different materials that have been approved for similar use and such materials are available from standard stock.\\n- The replacement of obsolete, worn-out or damaged parts, assemblies or components requiring renewal by those of later and more efficient design which has been previously approved by the SPM and such replacement does not cause a change to the system or equipment normally associated with the military characteristics of the ship.\\n- The strengthening of parts that require repair or replacement in order to improve reliability of the parts and of the unit, provided no other change in design is involved.\\n- The minor modification involves no significant changes in design or functioning of equipment but is considered essential to prevent recurrence of unsatisfactory conditions.\\n- The cost of the installation and maintenance of the new parts, assemblies or components is less than the cost of maintaining the installed parts, assemblies or components.\\n- The replacement of parts, assemblies or components does not cause a change to the existing system design or affect any interfacing system design and does not affect a change to the systems or equipment normally associated with the military or technical characteristics of the ship.\\n\\n6. Status Codes. Each Alteration has an associated status code that reflects if the alteration is Active or not. There are various codes that may indicate the alteration status, but for 3-M the only status code applicable for future modernization items is A-Active.\\n\\na. Alteration Status Code. With-in the NDE-NM database, the Alteration Status Code indicates whether or not an alteration is Active or not. It does not reflect if the Alteration is applicable for a specific class of ship or specific hull, class applicability or hull accomplishment status.\\n\\nb. Applicability Status Code. Within the NDE-NM database, the Applicability Status Code reflects the alteration status code for a specific hull for a specific modernization item. If the H-8 Appendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nApplicability status code is A=Applicable, B=Applicable-programmed, K=Package Alteration 17 Jun 2021 Authorized for Depot (Submarine Only) or L=Package Alteration Authorized for AIT (Submarine Only) then the modernization item is not complete for the indicated hull and can be scheduled or programmed for an availability. Any other code indicates the modernization item is complete, obsolete, equivalent or no longer applicable for the specific hull.\\n\\nc. Accomplishment Status Code. Within the NDE-NM database, the Accomplishment Status Code indicates a specific job accomplishment record for a specific hull. The status code options are the same as the Applicability Status Code. There may be multiple accomplishment records for one applicability item. This condition will exist when there are quantities greater than one for a specific hull.\\n\\n Methods of Install\\n\\nMethods of Install (MOI) is an NDE NM data field used to indicate the where and how an alteration installation is executed. The where is in relation to the type of availability and the how is whom the installer is. Currently there are 5 types of MOIs:\\nThis table provides descriptions of different types of installations related to ship maintenance and the processes involved in tracking and approving them.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTypes of Ship Installations and Approval Processes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Type: Different types of ship installations\\n- Description: Detailed descriptions of each type of installation and the approval processes involved\\n\\nThis table provides descriptions of different types of installations related to ship maintenance and the processes involved in tracking and approving them.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nTypes of Ship Installations and Approval Processes,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Type: Different types of ship installations\\n- Description: Detailed descriptions of each type of installation and the approval processes involved\\n\\n|Type|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|AIT Pier-side (AIT-P)|TYCOM controlled installation occurring usually in the ship’s homeport while the ship is pier-side.

Ship\\'s Force Requests for Configuration Changes. Ship\\'s Force requests for configuration changes not covered by applicable alterations must be submitted as TYCOM directed (refer to the TYCOM instruction). The request should be in the ship\\'s CSMP prefixed by the authorized alteration category \"AR\".\\n\\n13. Departure from Specification. When a component supported by the COSAL is replaced by a component with different repair part requirements but meeting the same specifications, the appropriate SYSCOM must authorize the exchange. Written communication is usually by Departure from Specifications (DFS) or Liaison Action Request (LAR) and subsequently documented by a completed Configuration Change Request (CCR).\\n\\n14. Certification of Shipyard Installed Alterations. The Naval Supervising Activity (NSA) provides a certification of alteration installation to the recipient ship when the alteration(s) is/are accomplished by the shipyard. This certification includes the Work Center, JSN assigned to the alteration, and the Final Action Taken. The certification will be in the format shown in reference (b), Volume VI, Chapter 19, Appendix F, Alteration Certification Letter. The ship must endorse the shipyard\\'s certification letter and forward to the supporting activity managing the unit\\'s Master CSMP. The endorsement provides authorization for information transmitted to be processed as completed deferrals in the Master CSMP. Refer to reference (b), Volume VI, Chapter 19, Appendix F. First Endorsement on Alt. Certification Letter. This eliminates the need for documenting multiple configuration changes (OPNAV Form 4790/CK) to close the CSMP deferral. Configuration changes made by the depot in accomplishing the alterations are reported separately from 3-M.\\n\\n15. Automated Data Process Between 3-M and Ship’s CSMP\\n\\n- a. Configuration and Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) Ships\\' 3-M automated programs are designed to accept applicable data for file, sort, and display. The alteration information is automatically passed from the SCLSIS CDMD-OA to automated ships via the Automated Shore Interface (ASI) process. For additional information on SCLSIS CDMD-OA and the ASI process refer to reference (a). Similarly, the MDS information may be transferred to a ship\\'s CSMP via the Master Job Catalog (MJC) when authorized for accomplishment.\\n- b. The communication link and interface procedures for processing 3-M and NDE-NM files, and CSMP file processing are contained in reference (a) and TYCOM instructions.\\n- c. The procedures for adding alteration records to the MJC, and distributing these changes to the TYCOM operating sites are contained in Appendix E and TYCOM instructions.\\n---\\nThis table provides information about a page intentionally left blank on June 17, 2021.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nPage intentionally left blank,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Content: None\\n- Page Number: None\\n\\nThis table provides information about a page intentionally left blank on June 17, 2021.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nPage intentionally left blank,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Content: None\\n- Page Number: None\\n\\n|Content|Page Number|\\n|---|---|\\n|Page intentionally left blank|17 Jun 2021|\\n\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n APPENDIX I 17 Jun 2021\\n\\nRELIABILITY-CENTERED MAINTENANCE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM (Formerly Appendix J)\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n APPENDIX I 17 Jun 2021\\n\\n RELIABILITY-CENTERED MAINTENANCE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM\\n\\n1.

Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Policy\\n\\na. All maintenance requirements must be developed using Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) methodology as directed by reference (a). The preventive maintenance actions required by reference (a) are to be developed per reference (b) to include preservation and maintenance requirements for equipment in an inactive status and calibration requirements related to the Shipboard Gage Calibration Program. PMS requirements must be developed concurrently with ship construction or conversion, the procurement of new shipboard systems or equipment and in support of research and development items. In addition, PMS requirements must be developed or revised to cover PMS changes which result when Ship Alterations (SHIPALTs), Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTs), Machine Alterations (MACHALTs), Field Changes (FC), or other engineering changes are authorized. Development and distribution of other preventive maintenance procedures for ships’ use is prohibited.\\n\\nb. NAVSEA 04RM designated PMS Coordinating Activities (PMSCA) are charged with the oversight of PMS, and are the only activities authorized to distribute PMS documentation. No other activities are authorized to distribute PMS documentation to ships. The PMSCA is the default Maintenance Coordinating Activity (MCA) for RCM analysis.\\n\\nc. PMS products developed by other SYSCOM activities must be integrated with NAVSEA PMS products into a single complete PMS package which is distributed by the PMSCAs.\\n\\nd. PMS documentation must be reviewed to ensure technical accuracy and the incorporation\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\nThis table lists various changes made on different dates related to configuration, technical manual, feedback report, and maintenance procedures.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nChanges Log,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Change Type: None\\n- Date: None\\n\\nThis table lists various changes made on different dates related to configuration, technical manual, feedback report, and maintenance procedures.,\\nwith the following table title:\\nChanges Log,\\nwith the following columns:\\n- Change Type: None\\n- Date: None\\n\\n|(1) Configuration changes|17 Jun 2021|\\n|---|---|\\n|(2) Technical manual changes| |\\n|(3) Feedback Report (FBR) changes| |\\n|(4) Improved maintenance procedures.| |\\n\\nAll documentation will be validated prior to distribution to the fleet. Where practical, validation will consist of the performance of the procedure on the subject system, sub-system or equipment for which the procedure was developed to verify accuracy of the documentation.\\n\\ne. PMS procedures should not include the following actions or items:\\n\\n- (1) Watch routines.\\n- (2) As a general rule, corrective maintenance actions must not be part of PMS. There are special circumstances that may allow corrective maintenance procedures to be included in PMS. These situations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis relying on the judgment of the PMSCA.\\n- (3) Major overhaul of equipment including tear down inspections or repair actions required to be done during an overhaul period. Scheduling of overhaul items may be included.\\n- (4) Facilities or housekeeping maintenance items.\\n- (5) Requirements that are documented by other means, such as underway check lists; boiler light off procedures, rounds fired logs, and any Operational Sequencing System (OSS) procedures.\\n- (6) Inventory checks such as repair locker check lists.\\n\\nf. Each Maintenance Index Page (MIP) and Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) must be a complete maintenance document containing all the information required to perform the task. Reference to other approved procedures must be restricted to an extreme minimum and must be approved by the PMSCA before inclusion on the MIP or MRC.\\n\\n 2. Waiver Policy\\n\\na. RCM Waivers. Maintenance requirements for shipboard equipment and systems must be developed using the RCM methodology detailed in reference (b). Waivers from developing requirements per reference (b) may be requested in the following circumstances:\\n\\nJ-2 Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n(1) The new maintenance requirement (e.g., MRC) is added to an existing MIP for a system already in PMS. Requests associated with the addition of a new maintenance requirement should include the following information:\\n\\n(a) Requirement description.\\n(b) Failure mode (i.e., material condition after failure) pe maintenance requirement is intended to prevent.\\n(c) Description of origination for pis new maintenance requirement. This description could include results of INSURV Material Inspection, Navy Safety Center Surface Ship Safety Survey findings, details of a preventable equipment casualty or performance of routine maintenance. If a reference exists (e.g., TFBR DDG 51 Ser 0051-02, INSURV message 031530Z OCT 02, etc.), identify pe reference.\\n(d) Explanation of how pe periodicity of pe requirement was determined (e.g., OEM recommendation, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) data).\\n(e) Details of actual failures occurring in pe Fleet which pis maintenance requirement will prevent, and frequency of pose failures.\\n(f) MIP and MRC information for any current and valid MRC or task pat is similar to pe proposed requirement.\\n(g) Additional technical information pat might support adjudication of pe waiver request.

Each Backfit RCM analysis should include a detailed rationale and justification addressing how this proposed task satisfies the Applicability and Effectiveness criteria for the proposed maintenance requirement.\\n\\n eWaiver Process and Workflow\\n\\nThe preferred method for submitting RCM or Man-Hour waiver requests is via the eWaiver application found on the NAVSEA ePMS Gateway available at: https://epmsgateway.pmsmis.navy.mil/Gateway/home.aspx. The eWaiver process has stringent review and approval requirements. eWaivers are processed via a rule-based workflow with specified roles. A waiver must be acknowledged by the Commodity Specialist (CS), In-Service Engineer (ISE) and Team Lead to ensure that the waiver is correctly defined and that the correct people have been identified for the review. Once the waiver has been acknowledged, it is returned to the Initiator to complete the analysis.\\nEach Backfit RCM analysis should include a detailed rationale and justification addressing how this proposed task satisfies the Applicability and Effectiveness criteria for the proposed maintenance requirement.\\n\\n eWaiver Process and Workflow\\n\\nThe preferred method for submitting RCM or Man-Hour waiver requests is via the eWaiver application found on the NAVSEA ePMS Gateway available at: https://epmsgateway.pmsmis.navy.mil/Gateway/home.aspx.

Once the waiver has been acknowledged, it is returned to the Initiator to complete the analysis. The completed waiver then proceeds from the Initiator through the CS, the ISE (optional) the Team Lead, the RCM Team and the NAVSEA Approver. Any individual in the workflow process can only have one role. For example, the Initiator cannot be the same person as the ISE. The ISE must review and approve a waiver from the Initiator before it can proceed through the approval process. Any of the review roles in the process may return the waiver to the Initiator for rework or additional information as necessary. The final decision on approval of an RCM or Man-Hour waiver request resides with NAVSEA 04RM.\\n\\na.

Provide processing for Category A Non-Technical Feedback Reports and for researching and resolving Category B, Technical Feedback Reports.\\n\\nc. Maintain the Planned Maintenance System Management Information System (PMSMIS).\\n\\n 9. PMS Changes as a Result of an Alteration\\n\\nThe alteration or change sponsor (SPM, TYCOM, etc.) must task and fund system and equipment Life Cycle Managers (LCMs) to develop new maintenance requirements per reference (b). If an RCM waiver is approved, they should task and fund revision to PMS documentation to reflect changes in systems and equipment resulting from alterations or changes. The proposed PMS documentation must be provided to the PMSCA at least 4 months prior to required PMS delivery date.\\n\\n 10. PMS for Foreign Navies (Former U.S. Navy Ships)\\n\\nPMS documentation requests from foreign navies for former U. S. Navy (USN) Ships must be processed as follows:\\n\\na. Requests for PMS coverage for foreign navies on former USN Ships must be directed to the NAVSEA International Fleet Support Program Office (PMS 326).\\n\\nJ-12 Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nb. Upon receipt of a request from a foreign navy for PMS coverage for a former USN ship, PMS 326 will request from pe appropriate PMSCA pe cost and availability of providing a one-time updated PMS package and wheper a List of Effective Pages (LOEP) is available for pe ship. If pe ship\\'s LOEP is not available, pen pe PMSCA will advise PMS 326 wheper anoper ship\\'s LOEP can be used as a verification document.\\nc. After receipt of a signed acceptance of pe support offer, PMS 326 will issue a funding document to pe appropriate PMSCA. Wipin 60 days, pe PMSCA will provide PMS 326 wip a LOEP and instruction for its use.\\nd. PMS 326 is to complete and return pe updated verified LOEP package to pe appropriate PMSCA.\\ne. The appropriate PMSCA will deliver a one-time updated PMS package based upon pe verified LOEP wipin pree monps after receipt. This updated package will include only data available in pe database. No new PMS development will be undertaken for equipment not having PMS coverage. Continuing PMS support will be provided if funded by PMS 326.\\n\\n11. PMS for Foreign Navies (New Construction, Modernization, Overhaul and Conversion). The USN Program Manager (PMs or SPMs) responsible for the specific foreign navy effort will provide funding to initiate new, or modify existing PMS documentation per the procedures described herein for USN ships. The Program Manager must be the sole authority for PMS requirements on cognizant foreign ships.\\n\\n12. PMS Feedback Reports (FBRs). FBRs are to be used for reporting technical and non-technical deficiencies or errors in PMS documents. Technical PMS discrepancies that could have a detrimental effect on personal safety, safety of ship, or could result in significant equipment damage, are classified as \"Urgent.\" All other FBRs are classified as “Routine.”\\n\\na.

FBR Handling Procedures\\n\\na. Urgent FBRs.\\n\\n- (1) Urgent FBRs are those feedbacks reporting technical discrepancies that can result in personnel injury, risk to the safety of the ship or significant equipment damage. PMSCAs must provide a message response, or electronic response if a message is not received, to all Urgent FBRs informing the originator of specific actions and required changes that will result from FBR evaluation or forward the FBR to the appropriate technical review activity or ISEA within 1 working day of receipt. This message response or electronic response must be addressed to the originator and distributed to TYCOMs. TYCOMs will forward this message to all commands that could be affected by PMS change. The Urgent FBR response message or electronic response may recommend pen and ink changes to the affected PMS requirement.\\n- (2) If the PMSCAs forward the FBR to a technical review activity or ISEA for resolution, then the technical review activity or ISEA must provide a message response, or electronic response if a message is not received, to all Urgent FBRs informing the originator of the specific actions and required changes that will result from the FBR evaluation within 1 working day of receipt. This message response or electronic response must be addressed to the originator and distributed to TYCOMs and PMSCAs. TYCOMs will forward this message or electronic response to all commands that could be affected by the PMS change. The Urgent FBR response message may recommend pen and ink changes to the affected PMS requirement.\\n- (3) PMSCAs must distribute revised PMS documentation to affected users within 30 calendar days of receipt via Special Issue or Advance Change Notice (ACN).\\n\\nb. Routine FBRs. PMSCAs must ensure completion of the technical review, research and provide a response to routine FBRs where resolution does not require technical authority action. FBRs that PMSCAs cannot resolve are sent to the cognizant technical review activity or ISEA. The cognizant technical review activity or ISEA will provide the response to the appropriate PMSCA. The response must describe the action taken and may recommend pen and ink changes to the affected PMS requirement. The PMSCAs will provide the response to the originator by electronic means. Distribution of the revised MRC to the originator and other affected users will be accomplished via Advance Change Notice (ACN) or Special Issue between Force Revisions (FRs). NAVSEA has established a goal of providing answers to all FBRs in one day. We realize that there are some TFBRs that will require more extensive research to answer and these FBRs\\n\\nJ-14 Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nWill not be able to meet this goal.\\nFBRs that PMSCAs cannot resolve are sent to the cognizant technical review activity or ISEA.

Special Issues are a category of ACN and are issues of new documentation between Force Revisions. A Special Issue represents a new MIP and at least one new MRC. A Special Issue may reflect newly developed documentation, or may reflect a change in the documentation a Command receives, such as the addition of a MIP and/or MRC(s) to the Work Center LOEP which the Command requires due to the addition of new equipment. Each Special Issue is serialized on every page. The serial number consists of the Special Issue indicator “SI”, originating activity code, serial number, MIP number, MRC number (if applicable), and revision date. Special Issues will be forwarded as a response to a locally-generated Feedback Report to the applicable hulls and/or activities.\\n\\n14. PMS FBR Response Instructions. All PMS FBRs must be answered using the guidelines in this paragraph.\\n\\na. For Concurrence Response.\\n\\n(1) If PMS documentation must be changed, pe revision information must be provided to pe appropriate PMSCA by electronic means. NAVSEA 04RM approved software may be used to make revisions to PMS documentation, but pe use of pis software should not delay pe response to pe appropriate PMSCA.\\n(2) If no revision to PMS documentation is required provide pertinent comments in pe response to pe appropriate PMSCA.\\n\\nb. For Non-concurrence Response. When not concurring with the feedback report, the rationale for non-concurrence must be given. The response must be electronically provided to the appropriate PMSCA with any applicable corporate history changes and revised documentation.\\n\\n Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nc. Critical Review Questions for the FBR Review. The following questions must be considered in the response to all FBRs:\\n\\n(1) What is pe Sailor\\'s question or problem?\\n(2) Is pe MRC necessary?\\n(3) What failure mode(s) does pe MRC prevent or detect?\\n(4) Is pe MRC clear and easy to follow?\\n(5) Is pe MRC safe for pe Sailor to accomplish?

When revising and distributing pe affected MIP, pe revision must include annotation of applicable ACNs.\\n\\n16. Admitting Network Software Procedures to the NAVY’s Planned Maintenance System\\n\\na. Background. Historically, PMS has addressed only hardware systems, equipment, and components including network hardware. Because network software tasks do not pass traditional RCM analysis, as called out in references (e) and (f), network software procedures cannot be added to PMS without an RCM waiver approved by NAVSEA 04RM. Including network software procedures in PMS establishes a sustainment infrastructure to manage, schedule, and track preventive maintenance for the preservation of data and the improvement of system reliability, availability, and security at reduced ownership costs. Due to the growth in networked systems and increasing reliance on these systems for both tactical and non-tactical functions, NAVSEA 04RM made a programmatic decision to accept RCM waiver requests for network software procedures from activities desiring to use the PMS repository and scheduling component. The original three-year window established in January 2007 to process RCM waiver\\n\\nJ-17 Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\nRequests for network software PMS has been permanently extended. In general, network software tasks added to PMS should attempt to reduce or eliminate the potential for data loss or corruption, system degradation or failure, and improve the capability for quick system recovery or restoration. A few examples of network software procedures in PMS include:\\n\\n- (1) Verifying proper switch spanning protocol,\\n- (2) Installing patches and updates,\\n- (3) Analyzing drives and executing defragmentation,\\n- (4) Verifying virus definition files,\\n- (5) Performing virus scans,\\n- (6) Reviewing server event logs,\\n- (7) Changing passwords,\\n- (8) Backing up the router current configuration file,\\n- (9) Performing system and drive backups.\\n\\nb. Process. The process to add new network software procedures into PMS is summarized in steps 16.b.(1) through 16.b.(7).\\n\\nManager. (1) An RCM waiver is submitted by the system owner, program manager, or Life-Cycle\\n\\n(2) Upon review and concurrence with request, the PMSCA Project Manager provides formal RCM waiver documentation to NAVSEA 04RM requesting that an RCM waiver be granted.\\n\\n(3) Upon NAVSEA 04RM approval of the waiver the applicant’s organization may start development of the actual procedures.\\n\\n(4) NSLC CSs will screen new procedures for appropriateness, and clarity, convert them to the correct MRC format, and assign the MRCs to the applicable MIP. Currently, new network software procedures are assigned to the associated hardware system MIP or System Software only MIP.\\n\\n(5) PMS FBR responses will be handled by the applicant’s Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and ISEA through PMSMIS with coordination by applicable NSLC CS.\\n\\n Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(6) Revisions (whether in response to FBRs or changes in software) to existing network software MRCs will be developed by the ISEA and SMEs associated with the software for which the network software MRCs apply. Conversion of revised MRCs into New PMS Editor (NPE) format and subsequent input to the PMS database will be performed by the NSLC CS who is assigned PMS life-cycle responsibilities for the hardware associated with the network software MRCs. If the revision is significant, PMSCA Team Leaders have the responsibility and authority to determine if PMSCA personnel should accomplish a Verification/Validation.\\n(5) PMS FBR responses will be handled by the applicant’s Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and ISEA through PMSMIS with coordination by applicable NSLC CS.\\n\\n Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\n(6) Revisions (whether in response to FBRs or changes in software) to existing network software MRCs will be developed by the ISEA and SMEs associated with the software for which the network software MRCs apply. Conversion of revised MRCs into New PMS Editor (NPE) format and subsequent input to the PMS database will be performed by the NSLC CS who is assigned PMS life-cycle responsibilities for the hardware associated with the network software MRCs. If the revision is significant, PMSCA Team Leaders have the responsibility and authority to determine if PMSCA personnel should accomplish a Verification/Validation. Should PMSCA make that decision, the ISEA (or Life-Cycle Manager) will be responsible for providing all the funding to cover expenses of the new Verification/Validation.\\n\\n(7) New MRCs to be added to an existing set of network software MRCs will be treated as if they were a new request for network software procedures, but a waiver request will not be required. NSLC will provide a cost estimate for its participation in the Verification/Validation (if deemed necessary) once costs can be determined. Verification/Validation will be handled by the CS who has PMS life-cycle responsibilities for the network software procedures.\\n\\n c. Requirements\\n\\nThe following process requirements govern the development, acceptance, and ongoing support of network software procedures within the PMS:\\n\\n1. An RCM waiver is required to add new network software procedures to PMS. The applicant (system owner, program manager, or Life-Cycle Manager) must provide NSLC, the PMSCA, a list of every system for which they are requesting a waiver. This list must contain the A/N nomenclature (if one is assigned) with all variants listed separately, for example, AN/USQ-153A(V)9, AN/USQ-153(V)4, AN/USQ-153B(V)6, and so on. If no A/N nomenclature is assigned, the applicant must provide sufficient information to identify each variant of the system for which the applicant might want to develop network software procedures. There are currently no plans to allow for automatic approval of later variants. All variants must be listed in the waiver request on file. Additional variants to be added later will require a new waiver.\\n2. Funding is required by NSLC for initial work of MRC conversion, on-site Verification/Validation, first-year FBR handling, LOEP preparation, and other services. Additional nominal costs will continue on an annual basis for long-term support by NSLC of the network software procedures in PMS. Funding must be in place for the appropriate NSLC CS prior to beginning the process for adding the new procedures to PMS.\\n3. An on-site visit is required to observe and verify the network software procedures (MRCs) being performed by personnel who normally operate the applicable system. If the system is a shipboard system, the Verification/Validation must take place onboard a ship that has the exact system for which the procedures are written, and the ship\\'s crew must perform the tasks, thus ensuring that Sailors understand and can perform the procedures. Exceptions to this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the final determination resting with PMSCA.\\n\\nJ-19 Appendix J\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nd.

When a component supported by the COSAL is replaced by a component with different repair part requirements, but meets the same equipment design specifications, the appropriate SYSCOM must authorize the exchange. The SYSCOM must also authorize exchanges of components replaced by non-supportive components.\\n\\n11. Alteration Management 3-M Reporting Requirements\\n\\nFor NMP managed alterations requiring logistic support, the 3-M documentation provided by the SYSCOM will have the Work Center, Job Sequence Number (JSN), and structured Alteration Number pre-assigned. These identifiers are used for tracking the life cycle of the alteration. This information is reported through the 3-M System as a configuration change. Refer to Section I, Chapter 4 and reference (b) the JFMM Volume VI, Chapter 19 for additional information on configuration reporting.\\n\\nIf the issuing authority does not provide the formatted 3-M WC/JSN and Alteration number, the ship will assign the JCN. The structure of the alteration number is left to the reporting activity, except for the first two or three positions that must have an authorized\\n\\nH-14 Appendix H\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nAlteration category prefix. Note that reference (d) contains additional types of configuration changes that are not applicable to 3-M reporting.\\n\\nShip\\'s Force Requests for Configuration Changes. Ship\\'s Force requests for configuration changes not covered by applicable alterations must be submitted as TYCOM directed (refer to the TYCOM instruction). The request should be in the ship\\'s CSMP prefixed by the authorized alteration category \"AR\".\\n\\nDeparture from Specification. When a component supported by the COSAL is replaced by a component with different repair part requirements but meeting the same specifications, the appropriate SYSCOM must authorize the exchange. Written communication is usually by Departure from Specifications (DFS) or Liaison Action Request (LAR) and subsequently documented by a completed Configuration Change Request (CCR).\\n\\nCertification of Shipyard Installed Alterations. The Naval Supervising Activity (NSA) provides a certification of alteration installation to the recipient ship when the alteration(s) is/are accomplished by the shipyard. This certification includes the Work Center, JSN assigned to the alteration, and the Final Action Taken. The certification will be in the format shown in reference (b), Volume VI, Chapter 19, Appendix F, Alteration Certification Letter. The ship must endorse the shipyard\\'s certification letter and forward to the supporting activity managing the unit\\'s Master CSMP. The endorsement provides authorization for information transmitted to be processed as completed deferrals in the Master CSMP. Refer to reference (b), Volume VI, Chapter 19, Appendix F. First Endorsement on Alt. Certification Letter. This eliminates the need for documenting multiple configuration changes (OPNAV Form 4790/CK) to close the CSMP deferral. Configuration changes made by the depot in accomplishing the alterations are reported separately from 3-M.\\n\\nAutomated Data Process Between 3-M and Ship’s CSMP', start_char_idx=1, end_char_idx=3400, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=-1.3221039772033691),\n",

Purpose\\n\\nThis chapter provides an overview of the Class Maintenance Plan (CMP), its content, applicability and discusses the development and management process. Throughout this document, the term “ship” refers to all surface ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines.\\n\\n 2. Overview\\n\\n1. a. Reference (a) requires each ship of a class to have a Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) approved CMP. The CMP contains detailed Organizational (O-Level), Intermediate (I-Level) and Depot (D-Level) maintenance requirements and notional maintenance cycles as tasked and funded by the Program Executive Offices (PEO).\\n2. b. CMP requirements are developed using RCM methodology as described in reference (b) and executed following Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) methodology as defined in reference (c).\\n3. c. Each CMP is developed to provide the information needed to plan, schedule and control I-level and D-level planned maintenance effectively. The cognizant life cycle maintenance planning activities -- Carrier Planning Activity (CPA), Submarine Maintenance Engineering for Planning and Procurement (SUBMEPP), and Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) -- manage requirements and scheduling of D-Level and I-Level maintenance requirements.

For equipment and systems for which an adequate assessment MRC has yet to be developed, the technical authority or the Technical Warrant Holder for the subject system or equipment may approve the use of other test formats. These formats can include but are not limited to technical manual procedures, System Operation and Verification Test (SOVT) procedures, shipyard test procedures or approved shipboard procedures. Shipboard procedures could include the use of Combat Systems Operational Sequencing System (CSOSS) or Engineering Operational Sequencing System (EOSS) procedures. In all cases, formats other than MRC procedures should be considered temporary. APs should be developed as MRCs to the maximum extent possible. MRCs are integral to the resourced 3-M Program of Record and are always available on the platform via Force Revisions. APs are used primarily by off-ship subject matter experts, but also may be used by Ship’s Force, with technical authority oversight, as a key element of distance support. APs must include all data fields required by reference (b) for MRCs. APs must clearly identify and explain all requirements needed to satisfy Inspection Points and Certification Statements. APs must be prepared using the NAVSEA New PMS Editor application.\\n\\n(2) Approved APs must be issued and managed per this instruction as part of the Navy’s Planned Maintenance System Management Information System (PMSMIS) database. CMP tasks may be used to call out the use of the APs. Discrepancies associated with and requests for modifications to APs or associated CMP tasks must be reported via the 3-M Feedback Report (FBR) System.\\n\\n(3) APs must be self-contained to the maximum extent practicable. The goal is to require minimum reference to other documents except for general references (e.g. NSTM 300 reference to electrical safety requirements) or to EOSS or CSOSS procedures.\\n\\n(4) Each AP must state qualification requirements and specify the skill, non-typical labor category, or both, required to perform the procedure. Examples include NAVSEA-designated\\n\\n4-3\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nassessors and specific Ship’s Force ratings and ranks. Personnel with the qualifications listed on\\nthe AP possess the required skill and knowledge levels required to safely and efficiently execute\\nthe procedure.\\n\\n1. APs must be thoroughly shipboard tested prior to implementation. Satisfactory\\ncompletion of this testing must be recorded in PMSMIS along with RCM analysis\\ndocumentation.\\n2. Procedural steps and situational triggers must be presented in language that is free of\\nvague and ambiguous terms and uses simple words and phrases to convey the intended meaning.\\nAppendices C and F of reference (c) provide writing and word choice guidelines.\\n3. Procedures must clearly define all failure modes and effects the procedure is designed\\nto predict, identify, prevent or correct. Specific criteria must be provided to evaluate satisfactory\\nand unsatisfactory conditions associated with these failure modes. In certain cases, such as\\nextensive assessments of large or complex systems, it may be appropriate to define functional\\nfailures (e.g., low-level alarm fails to sound) vice functional failure (relay K-12 shorted to\\nground). In such cases, the generation of a Maintenance Action Form OPNAV 4790/2K noting\\ncompletion of the task should lead to troubleshooting and repair actions.\\n4. Procedures must include failure threshold criteria values or parameters required to\\nsatisfy inspection or certification requirements. The implication of failure modes associated with\\nbeing above or below threshold, including specific economic, safety or mission impacting\\nconcerns or operational limitations must be included in the procedure. Examples include:\\n- (a) Increased cost to repair if rust is allowed to exceed some percent of exposed surface.\\n- (b) Significantly increased probability of line shaft bearing failure that would require decoupling of the shaft and subsequent reduction in top speed if bearing clearance is allowed to exceed some value.\\n- (c) Eventual deterioration of electrical insulation leading to risk of electrical shock and death if resistance value is allowed to decrease below a critical value.\\n- (d) Decertification of flight deck and restriction to \"emergency only\" flight deck operations if certain equipment is inoperable.\\n5. APs must explicitly address generation of a completion Maintenance Action Form OPNAV 4790/2K when required for recording of data for material condition history, inspection, or certification purposes or to document the need for corrective action.\\n6. APs must explicitly specify where and when measurements are to be taken, and how data is to be recorded.'],\n",

Purpose\\n\\nThis appendix describes the Automated Periodic Maintenance Program (APMP) capabilities, provides guidelines for its use, and standardizes the requirements in support of fleet and Depot 3-M reporting. This program was established to assist maintenance and material managers in the execution of Class Maintenance Plan (CMP) and Life Cycle Manager (LCM) maintenance requirements to sustain weapon system operability.\\n\\n2. Scope\\n\\nIntermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) require the capability to generate work requests for periodic maintenance. Periodic Maintenance Requirements (PMR) provide that capability. PMRs also provide the capability to schedule, maintain, issue and report work accomplished for PMR items. PMR data elements conform to 3-M standards. PMRs require the reporting of maintenance actions and configuration changes on all categories of equipment.\\n\\n3. Objective\\n\\nThe APMP can provide a means to effectively manage and control all PMRs beyond the scope of the Planned Maintenance System (PMS). It is managed by integrating Systems Command (SYSCOM) Life Cycle Requirements, Configuration Data Managers' Database, Open Architecture (CDMD-OA) configuration data and periodicities invoked by system and equipment engineers with the 3-M Master Job Catalog (MJC) and PMR modules of intermediate maintenance management automated systems. This integration provides an automated pre-planned deferral to be added to the Current Ship's Maintenance Project (CSMP) and procurement of repair parts specified by technical repair standards or other controlled work procedures. The system:\\n\\n- Provides continuous evaluation and adjustment of the CMP to reflect the specifications of the SYSCOM Platform Managers and the capabilities and capacities of fleet maintenance activities.\\n---\\n NAVSEAINST 4790.8D\\n\\n17 Jun 2021\\n\\nb. Adjusts the Ship Configuration and Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) and the Configuration Data Manager (CDM) databases to reflect all levels of equipment and components for existing and emerging PMRs.\\n\\nc. Develops, evaluates and implements a MJC deferral for each PMR added to the CMP.\\n\\nd. Distributes a Unit Identification Code (UIC) unique configuration and scheduling record for each CMP periodic requirement to each activity maintaining the equipment/component.\\n\\ne. Maintains the MJC and PMR database at the central facility (regional hub, port facility, Regional Support Group (RSG) or Parent Squadron/IMA) supporting ship classes.\\n\\nf. Plans and executes ship scheduled availabilities and planned work packages by retrieval of all scheduled PMRs, alterations, Type Commander (TYCOM) directed and local support routines from the MJC/PMR module and all screened deficiencies from the tended ship's CSMP into the Master CSMP of the central facility.\\n\\ng. Manages the execution of all authorized work, ensuring the progress, status change, delay and completion of each task is reported into 3-M as detailed in the applicable program user manuals.\\n\\nh. Produces and distributes PMR, CSMP and production information (Availability Summaries, Key Event Schedules and Progress, AWRs, Calibration Summaries, CSMP Summaries, etc.) as specified by TYCOM directives.\\n\\ni.
